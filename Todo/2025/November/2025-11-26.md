                        - TEST_WITHOUT_LEARN: I had not checked the official info before testing by myself for some options.
                        - LAST_OPTION: During test MS authenticator I realized that all other 4 options did not meet some of my requirements, and the MS one passed all other requirements except the one of export/import which was about to be tested.
                        - JUMP: I took it for granted that it must have the functionality, then I just skipped the test, installed it and add all my accounts. 
                        - FAIL: When I turned back to this test I did not find this function in the APP. When I checked the official site it verified my worry that export/import is NOT supported.
