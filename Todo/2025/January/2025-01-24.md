                        - CASE
                            - GENERAL_PHILOSOPHY: When I think of general philosophy I tend to pause daily tasks.
                            - TASK_MANAGEMENT: I tend to pause all other tasks when conceiving a task management model 
                            - DEPENDENCY_TREE: about tools in goal achievement
                                - DELAY_DEVICE_SETUP: When I am think of a tree model in goal achievement, I tend to avoid all device setup tasks.
                                - LAPTOP_SETUP_TREE_TO_CHAINS: the tool parts include energy, support and keyboard, then I convert the dependency resolution into 3 chains. 
                            - DEVICE_RULE: 
                                - DELAY_ALL_PROBLEMS: I plan to deduce a new localization model to cover the device cases in which error msgs or policies matter, then I delay all problem solving tasks.
                                - NOT_AFFECTED: these problems are only about flows not rules.
                                    - CEILING_LIGHT_BROKEN

                                - USE_PSYCHO_MODEL: if the problem is about the rules of a device, I use my human psycho model to handle it currently.
                            - NEW_THOUGHT_IN_APPLICATION: when handling a task I might find a point that my model can not handle well, then I might conceive a temporary new method. I theorize and doc this method later after this task.
                                - FILLER_IN_GAP: I fill the gap between the arm main part and the connector to prevent them from moving against each other.

                            - CONDITION
                                - UNFINISHED_MODEL: I am in the middle of refining a model.
                                - FACE_TASK: I face tasks that **might** require a better model.

                                    - NEW_MODEL_NOT_DELAY_TASK: I might accumulate many tasks if I do not handle them before the new model is completed.
                                    - OLD_MODEL_NOT_MESS_TASK: I might handle them poorly with the old model.
                                        - SLOW: the handling process is slow.
                                        - SUBOPTIMAL_OPTION: the solution that I choose might cost much, and the situation might relapse soon.

                                    - NO_PERFECT_MODEL: I can not make sure that my model can handle the next task 100 percent if the task is a unmet one. Even if I just refined my model, I might face difficulty in the next task.
                                    - ANYTIME_IS_TRANSITION:  I might need to come up with a new method on the fly to handle the difficulty if the task is urgent. This case and the corresponding new method need to be recorded for later modeling.
                                    - LOCALIZE_MODEL_FLAW: specify at which step I am stuck.

                                    - MATURE: the full modeling process is finished, and the written procedure is memorized.
                                    - CURRENT: mature + mental patches
                                        - MENTAL_PATCH: new ideas from difficulties after the mature model. A patch is just refinement to a single step in a procedure and can be retrieved and applied with ease.
                                    - UNFINISHED: the model in a thinking case, with records but not finished.
                            - PROCEDURE: apply the current
                                1. APPLY_MATURE: firstly try to apply the mature model 
                                2. WHEN_DIFFICULTY: when I encounter a difficult point
                                    1. EXISTING_PATCH: apply a patch if there is a working one
                                    2. NEW_PATCH: otherwise think of a new patch
                                        1. ORGANIZE: organize the new patch in mind.

                                                    - PROCEDURE: the patch procedure in contrast to the original procedure in the mature model 
                                        2. APPLY
