                        - GENERAL_PHILOSOPHY: When I think of general philosophy I tend to pause daily tasks.
                        - TASK_MANAGEMENT: I tend to pause all other tasks when conceiving a task management model 
                        - DEPENDENCY_TREE: When I am think of a tree model in goal achievement, I tend to avoid all device setup tasks. 
                        - DEVICE_LOCALIZATION: I plan to deduce a new localization model to cover the device cases in which error msgs or policies matter, then I delay all problem solving tasks.

                        - CONDITIONS: when I think of
                            - LARGE_SCOPE_MODEL: a general model covering many cases. 
                            - CHANGING_PREVIOUS_MODEL: a model might modify (not just extend) the old one.

                                - UNRELATED_TASKS: handle these which are not related to the model undergoing refinement during rest.
                            - SECURITY
                                - NECESSARY_TASKS: handle these on time before the new model is completed which might take a long time.
                        - PHILOSOPHY
                            - LARGE_TASKS_COST_DAYS
                                - MODELING: a major change to a large-scale model costs days even weeks of work.
                            - THINKING_INTERLEAVING: I can only focus on one task continuously or each day for a certain period of time.
                            - LOCALIZE_MODEL_FLAW: A model usually can handle different cases, so its flaw might affect only a portion of targeting cases.
