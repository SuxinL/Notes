1. all other models --> the modeling model: I use the modeling model to create all other models
2. root: how to create the modeling model?
    - clue 1: the root of applying models is to TEST THE CURRENT SYSTEM
        - goal orientation
    - clue 2: Initially, I did NOT use the modeling model to create models of
        - goal achievement
        - problem solving
        - learning
3. modeling history
    1. 2023/05: 
        - build: 
            - based on **STATE TRANSFER**. -> 
                - pros: this root is universal and true.
            - Each model has its own article. -> 
                - pros: easy to organize
        - refine: refine a model in its article each time. -> 
            - cons: 
                - too_many_updates: the model is updated almost after each time I apply it to a new task.
                - over_fitting
    2. 2024
        - refine: only record thoughts in the TODO of that day.
            - pros:
                - stable_model: the model in the article remain stable for long.
            - cons: 
                - hard_to_organize: the same part might be refined multiple times, but these updates are shattered.
    3. 2024/07
        - build: record new models in the **thinking** part of TODO of that day. -> laziness
            - pros: neat & quick
            - cons: hard to organize
        - refine: after collecting enough cases
            - pros: stable models
            - cons: tasks suffer poor models before models are fully refined.
    4. 2025/02
        - refine: use **patches**
            - pros: solve the problem of suffer
            - cons: still shattered
    5. goal
        - efficiency
            - search: quick -> a tree structure
            - model
                - general -> collect enough cases before a refinement
                - case-fit -> patch recorded for a later refinement
        - safety
            - model
                - clear: separate thought from procedure in doc
                    - procedure -> one article for one mature model  -> quick apply
                    - thought log -> a step of a model has its article of thoughts
                        - refinement log
