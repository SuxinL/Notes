                    - PRINCIPLE
                        - GENERALIZATION: the repair can be
                            - clean: protect a tool from wearing, erosion and missing

                            - AS_BATCH: if there are copies, handle them together.
                        - STRUCTURE_ALWAYS: even if I decide to delay the repair, put the object at a good location.
