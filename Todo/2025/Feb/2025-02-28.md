            - CASE
                - I decide to use leechblock on Firefox for Android.
                - The part of blocking leechblock config page in the extension manager does not work. No effect.
                - I retried many times.
                - Then I reinstalled Blocksite and rebuilt sets, but I have not hidden it. 
                - Time was late, then I went to bed, but I was unsatisfied with the result and felt anxious.

                        - gas of high pressure in two chambers separated by a piston
                            - the upper has a larger area
                        - connected
                            - F(upper) > F(down) -> the piston is still to the base, then the cylinder moves up
                            - when external force is applied, the cylinder is pressed down.

                                    - the cylinder moves against the piston which is fixed on the base cover.
                - piston
                    - divide the chamber into two parts
                    - create differences between the effective area of the upper end and that of the low end.
                - cylinder

                                1. the upper part of the chamber is connected with the down part through the tube, then equal pressure in two parts.
                                2. due to the differences about the effective areas of the two sides of the piston, the upper part of the chamber apply more force on the piston than the lower part does.
                                3. the cylinder moves up against the piston.
                                4. if there are external downward forces applied to the cylinder like someone sitting on the seat, the cylinder can move down as a result of a net of forces.
                            - valve close
                - base cover
                    - fix the piston
