        - [ ] I skip some explanation without check it specifically when learning gas lift 
            - CASE
                - I like the one with a diagram and long explanation
                - I skip one because it
                    - short
                    - no diagram
                    - mention the term of gas exit, but the chamber is sealed
                - but when I think of the preferred one, I find that it does not explain some parts well.
                - the skipped ones mention an important term - gas spring.
