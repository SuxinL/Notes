            - CASE
                - I chose a phone of 128GB from a shop
                - I planed to buy a cheap SD card to expend the storage.
                - The coupon about the same type of phone of 256GB from another shop surprised me a lot.
                - Then I ordered it, forgetting the issue of the storage size.
                - After the purchase I found that the shop also sold the version of 128GB.
