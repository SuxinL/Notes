        - [x] what

            a practice of managing power usage by suspending parts of the system.

        - [x] purpose
            - to save power and extend a battery life.
        - [x] when 
            - The batteries are expensive.
            - Battery capacities are small.
        - [x] where
            - linux
        - [x] how
            - system suspend
                - what: suspends the CPU and most of components.
                - when: not using the laptop but wanting to preserve the state.
                - how: suspend/hibernate 
            - dynamic suspend
                - what: suspends a device while the system remains running.
                - when: a device is seldomly used.
                - how
                    - philosophy
                        - In linux, for system stability, only the kernel can decide to suspend an individual device, while programs or end-users cannot directly ask to do so. In general, the kernel will suspend a device when it has been idle for a specific duration. 
                    - structure
                        ```mermaid
                        flowchart
                            subgraph running
                                B(busy)
                                I(idle)
                            end
                            S(suspended)

                            B --> I
                            I --> B
                            I --> |auto suspend|S
                            I --> |system suspend|S
                            S --> |auto resume| running
                            S --> |external resume| running
                        ```

                        - idle: A device is idle whenever the kernel thinks that it is not busy doing something.
                        - suspended: When a device is suspended, it is in a nonfunctioning low-power state; it might even be turned off completely.
                    - events
                        - internal: those triggered inside the laptop. 
                            - auto suspend: Auto suspend is just dynamic suspend decided by the kernel.
                            - auto resume: The kernel automatically resumes a device when a program needs to use it. 
                        - external: those triggered by external agents like end-users.
                            - system suspend: when a user asks to suspend the whole system, the device is forced to suspend.
                            - external resume
                                - system resume
                                - manual dynamic resume: A user asks a device to resume like through sysfs power config.
                                - remote wakeup
            
                                    The device resumes itself in response to some external events. For instance, a suspended keyboard could resume when a key is pressed.

                                    Making a suspended device in a low-power state rather than turned off cracks this **chicken-egg problem**. The device can resume itself by 
                                    - itself
                                    - asking the kernel to resume it
                                    - telling the entire computer to resume
                    - user interfaces for config

                        In sysfs, there is `power` dir for each device traced from the bus view like `/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:1f.6/power`. Under this `power` dir are 3 attribute files to config auto-suspend and remote-wake.
                        - `control`
                            - `on`: always running
                            - `auto`: auto-suspend enabled.
                        - `autosuspend_delay_ms`: the delay time duration in ms before a device should be auto suspended.
                        - `wakeup`
                            - empty: remote wakeup is not supported. 
                            - `disabled` 
                            - `enabled`   
                        > NOTICE: sysfs provides an interface to access kernel objects which are in the memory. To make this config persist, edit `/etc/sysfs.conf` provided by `sysfsutils`.
