    - [ ] what

        Git is a distributed version control system.
    - [ ] purposes
        - efficiency
            - version management: Git manages versions in a dir `.git` automatically, and avoids side effects on workspace. Users can switch versions via easy interfaces with Git.
            - local: No network is needed. The local repository contains all data needed to do version control work except synchronization.
            - collaboration: Git provides functionalities to communicate with remote servers.
        - security
            - distributed design: avoids a single point of failure.
            - backup: The remote repository can also act as a backup. 
    - [ ] when
        - to record versions for later reference.
        - collaboration
    - [ ] where
        - cross-platform
        - for any project.

                    - [ ] philosophy
                        - snapshot not diff: Git stores a snapshot of a project for a commit, then the history is a series of snapshots not patches.
                            - retrieving a state of the project is instant, rather than by adding patches from the initial state.

                    - [ ] philosophy
                        - [ ] Copy not move: Moving a file from a place to another place here means copying and pasting the file to override the one in the destination.

                        - the index: the pending snapshot preparing for the next commit.

                            - [ ] overview `git status`: displays paths having diff between HEAD and the index or between the index and the working tree.
                            - [ ] files `git diff`: displays diff in the unit of lines of files.
                            - [ ] `git ls-files`: display the content of the index and the working tree. 
                        - [ ] set

                            - [ ] `git commit`: snapshot the index and store a commit in the repository
                            - [ ] `git remove`: remove a path from the index.
                - [ ] branches
                    - [ ] philosophy
                        - branches are refs: In git, a branch is a just reference pointing to a commit.
                            - It is cheap to create a new branch. Only a new ref is created and no real branch copying is needed.

            - [ ] remote
                - [ ] philosophy
                    - 2-level
                        - repository: where to sync
                        - ref: what to sync
                    - remote-tracking: for each involved remote branches, there is local remote-tracking branch reflecting its state at the last time of synchronization.

            - [ ] philosophy
                - encryption

                    the channel is encrypted since before the authentication process. 
                - authentication
                
                    both-side authentications are requested.

                    - server
                        - **Trust On First Use**: The end user checks the public key of the server manually before the first time of communication. 
                            - If it is authentic, the client stores it for later automatic checking.
                            - less overhead than certificates but manual work needed.
            - [ ] client
                - [ ] ssh: the ssh client to log in to and run commands on remote servers.
                - [ ] ssh-agent: holds identities including private keys.
