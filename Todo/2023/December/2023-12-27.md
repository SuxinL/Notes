        to easily manage all drivers **at one place**.
    - [x] when

    - [x] how
        - [x] philosophy
            - package: Driver files are treated as modules in Ubuntu, which are a type of packages.
            - kernel-builtin: Unlike Windows where we need to install drivers by ourselves, Linux kernels include most of drivers already, then makes a system usable out of box. We need to install drivers if we want to use propriety ones.  
        - [x] types
            - general way: APT
            - driver oriented: **these tools only display available propriety drivers**
                - CLI: `ubuntu-drivers`
                - GUI: Additional Drivers
