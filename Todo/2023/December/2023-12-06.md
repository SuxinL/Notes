                    1. fetch: all branches

        - [ ] merge
            - [ ] what
  
                merges changes of another branch into the current branch
            - [ ] purposes
            
                to add finished works into a main branch

        - [ ] rebase
            - [ ] what

                reapply commits of a branch on top of another branch

            - [ ] purposes
                - make history clear
                - group related commits together
                - remove bugged commits
            - [ ] how
                - [ ] principles
                    - diff oriented: not just resetting parents pointers only, replaying a commit in rebasing means replaying differences introduced in the commit.
