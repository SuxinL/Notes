                - ease to use
    - [x] refine the learning model for composite tool and system.
        - [x] composite: if a tool consist of multiple sub individual tools like vscode including extension system and editor system or git including the 3-tree system and branch system, arrange them in a tree structure.
        - [x] leaf: if multiple interfaces access the same system and there involves state changes like `git add` and `git commit` in git 3-tree system, specify the system via state diagrams.
