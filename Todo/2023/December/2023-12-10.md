        - my theory: Our brains always compress memory.
        - support: we can always take in new information. In the contrary, computers store data precisely, but cannot store new data when the disks are full.

            - the number of brain cells decreases.
            - the amount of chemicals for memory deceases.

            - babies have small brains and little memory.
