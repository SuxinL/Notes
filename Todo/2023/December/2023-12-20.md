- [x] cooking thinking
    - [x] Get: Moving something from a place to another place: the break and build of interfaces between the object and its environment. Along this path, we need to check affected things
        - containers
            - for a reusable container like a box or a drawer, we need to make it return to its initial state.
            - for a one-time-use container, like the package of the subject moved, we dispose it well as garbage.
        - the final direct interface
            - the effects on the moved subject. For instance, if a pot is dirty, we need to clean it before putting foods into it.
            - the effects on the new env. If food is too hot, we need to cool it for a while before sending it to our mouths.
