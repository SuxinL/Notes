		- if it is here currently or ever existed
			- abstract: positive instances of specific ones
			- specific: catching (photos, videos, witnesses) ==Notice fake evidence==
		- if it is a prediction or no catching is found: 
			- prediction: deduction from now
			- no catching

- empiricism
	- by self: costing materials
	- by others: a risk of cheating and fake remarks  
- rationalism
	- costing brain power
	- very hard and inaccurate in cases containing too much factors.

- Proof by positive instances is not trustworthy nowadays when disinformation is everywhere **unless it is from reliable resources**.
- Then rationalism is very important to reduce risks and increase confidence & trust.

- starting point of backward reasoning: the bad effects.
