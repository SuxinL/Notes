- [ ] thought flow of how a battery work
	- Fact: Connecting a Cu electrode and a Fe one inserted into a dead frog body with an external metal wire will produce an electric flow.
	- plan: through explaining how this example works, we deduct the general mechanism of batteries
		- Q: which of Fe or Cu is more easier to lose electrons?
			- based on **electron shell theory**
		- Q: why is an external connection needed for the flow?
- [ ] learn electron configuration theory
	- [ ] shell
	- [ ] subshell
	- [ ] Q: What is metallic character?
- [ ] learn to use laptop batteries **in a good manner**
	- [x] initial test
	- [ ] act
	- [ ] final test
	- [ ] post
	- Why will a battery degrade?
	- When to charge
		- **Will plugging in all the time damage batteries?** Induction: N
	- hibernation
		- Will batteries be consumed during hibernation? Induction: N
	- ubuntu power management
- [ ] replace the battery
- [ ] replace the keyboard bond
