- [ ] **refine problem solving model**
    - [ ] tests V.S effects
        - [ ] functionality(dynamic, goal-oriented)
            - observe the final output of a process
        - [ ] presence(static)
            - [ ] tests: observe it 
                - directly
                - by tools like microscopes and UIs(signals and indicators) 
                - specification
            - [ ] effects: for things hard to observe including theories, observe its effects on related things
                - dependency: observe something using it, like a site visit failure if the network is unavailable.
                - affected: observe something that it acts on and affects like symptoms of an underlying medical conditions.
                - hypothetical deduction: Can the theory explain the situation?
