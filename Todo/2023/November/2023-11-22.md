            A distributed version control system. Users can pull the project from the cloud into local devices, develope on the local version, and push changes to the cloud.

        - [ ] purposes
            - safety
                - A user can reverse changes and return back to a previous saved version if something goes wrong.
            - collaboration
                - changes from different developers can be merged.
        - [ ] when
            - for important files
            - long-term developments
            - collaboration

            - Git runs locally.

            - [ ] structure
                - file
                    - for each project managed by Git, there is a dir `.git` under the root dir holding all data Git needs to achieve version control.

                        - [ ] the working tree
                            - what: the current project in files
                            - purposes: the subject that a developer edits.
                        - [ ] the index
                            - what: the place to prepare the next commit
                            - purposes: as a buffer to enable multiple changed files in the next commits
                        - [ ] commits
                            - what: a commit is a snapshot of the project at some instant. The commit paths represent the history.
                            - purposes: record traces.
                    - [ ] **transfer**
                        - add: add changed files to the index 
                        - commit: commit the index

        - [ ] my theory
            - **copy**
                - add: a file copied from working tree to the index
                - commit: the whole content in the index copied into git database.
                - Support:
                    - we can commit when a file is changed after added into the index.
            - ~~**we can not change past**~~
                - ~~each branch has one working tree and one index available on the newest commit.~~
            - we CAN change past, via `reset`, and squash commits.
