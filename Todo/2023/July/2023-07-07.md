  - [x] Is systemd journal a superset of the  kernal ring buffer?
  
    yes, including this and other resources.
    
  - [x] How to use `journalctl` to search all Chrome-related logs?
    - `grep chrome`
     
- [x] **swapfiles are temporary?** 

  Swapon makes effect only during current session. After reboot the swap area is off.

  **Remember to add a line about the swap area to file /etc/fstab to make system turn on it after each reboot.**

  NO.
