            - case
                - I planed to have a rest, but I did not know other ways other than watching videos or gossips.
                - So I watched "Dee Girls Talk"
                - I should stop at 17 pm, but in fact I watched till 17:30 pm.

        - [x] to clean the washing machine
            - case
                - I planed to firstly clean the washing machine bucket, then wash clothes.
                - But I have delayed the clean for 3 weeks.
            - thought
                - [x] ~~COST GREATER THAN BENEFITS~~: a view
                - [x] ~~TIRED BODY~~: a feeling, can not be replaced directly, handle it causes.
                - [x] **COST & BENEFIT: analyze**
                    - cost
                        - basic: learn to clean the bucket -> solution: learn from the manual to reduce cost.
                            - dissemble the bucket 
                        - **risk**
                            - challenge my knowledge model further 
                                - possibility: **little possible for simple electronics**
                                - handling if happening: need to adjust models for all learned knowledge 
                                    1. localize affected parts:
                                        - this model is about managing small points into a system. the main points (what, purposes, when, where) do not change for modules. **And** it is not hard to change structures (link patterns between modules).
                                        - currently I have only 2 main pending issues about my model.
                                    2. legacy system: only adjust the model for something learned if
                                        - the used model does not work well.
                                        - OR I need to specify the knowledge further.
                    - benefit
                        - clothes
                            - to have clear ones to wear
                            - avoid dirty ones from being damaged by molds
                        - wash machine
                            - understand more, then more willing and easier to use it
                        - knowledge model
                            - maybe: support my existing model, then boost self confidence.

        - [x] to repair the bath sprinkler
            - case
                - I know how to repair it.
                - But I delay it.
                - I want to firstly summarize and document the knowledge and problem solving model for adhesives, then apply to specific cases.
                - But this time Zhou needs it soon.
            - thought
                - [x] long-term efficient solution: It relates to the knowledge of adhesives which covers many problems that I need to handle
                    - wire hooks

                    - bath sprinkler
                    - wall sprinkler hook
                - [x] Zhou needs it now: **reality principle**. When it is needed in emergency, I apply the quick solution which is not the best but fits the current situation. 
                    - apply: the maximal contacting area
                        - enough glue
                        - no impurity
                    - wait: curing time

                - whenever I think of China, I feel angry and my thinking is disrupted.
