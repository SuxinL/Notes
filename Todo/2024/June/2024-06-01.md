        - [x] act
            - [x] heat on for flavor 
                - [x] proteins: coagulate, 60C
                - [x] starches: absorb water, then swell and soften, 66C
                - [x] sugars: break down, then turn blown and have more flavors, 170C
                - [x] amino acids + reducing sugars: turn blown, get flavors
            - [x] digestion
                - [x] protein: testing: yes
                - [x] starch: degrade to glucoses

                - [x] what degrees for how long
                    -  [x] degree: over 80C to kill most food borne poisoning bacteria
                    -  [x] duration: 2 mins  
        - [x] test
            - what
                - heat alters raw foods into what we want.
            - purpose
                - efficiency
                    - digestibility

            - when
            - where
            - how
                - safety
                    - Food borne poisoning bacteria can be found in raw poultry, meat and vegetables.
                    - Cooking with heat can kill most of them.
                        - temperature: over 80C inside
                        - duration: 2 mins
                 - flavor
                    - protein
                        - denaturation

                            Heat breaks hydrogen bonds holding amino acid strands, which then enable these strands to unfold and react with other substances to form new structures.
                            - conditions
                                - temp: > 60C
                            - effects
                                - harden: most meats transform from a runny, fluid texture to a firm one.
                                - soften: collagen -> gelatine
                    - starch
                        - Gelatinization

                            When heated, starches absorb liquids around them.
                            - conditions
                                - temp: > 66C
                                - liquid
                            - effects
                                - swell
                                - soften
                        - Degradation
                            When heated, starch molecules break down into glucoses.
                            - effects
                                - starchy foods become sweeter.
                    - sugar
                        - caramelization    

                            When heat is applied, sugar decomposes into its component molecules. Then a further series of complex chemical reactions take place between the molecules.
                            - conditions
                                - temp: 180C
                            - effects
                                - brown color
                                - complex flavor
                    - amino acid
                        - Maillard Reaction

                            Under heat, amino acids react with reducing sugars.
                            - condition
                                - reducing sugars
                            - effects
                                - brown outside
                                - complex flavor
                - digestibility
                    - starch
                        - cause: Starches degrade into glucoses which is easier to digest.
                    - protein
                        - test: Cooked eggs are 180% more digestible.
