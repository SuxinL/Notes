        - [x] ask a waiter his age
            - case
                - CURIOSITY: I found that the waiter looked very young. Then I discussed with Zhou his age.
                - REASON
                    - < 18
                        - EFFECT: 
                            - He looked like a middle school student. <- He might just finished the exams to take a summer-time job.
                    - >= 18
                        - CAUSE: Waiters lower than 18 are not allowed in law.
                - TEST: I believe that testing is the best method.
                - ANXIETY: When he was serving us I started to ask him. But I felt anxious.
            - thought
                - [x] ANXIETY:
                    - [x] analyze risks: damage to self esteem
                        - [x] rejection: He refuses to tell me.

                                - [x] ~~not available now~~: He is serving us and not busy.

                flowchart LR
                    DEP --> TOOL --> OBJECT

                    TOOL --> WASTE
                ```
                1. Encountering a tool, we firstly consider its env
                    - dep
                        - energy: 
                            - human force
                            - fuel
                            - electricity
                        - other services: 
                            - networks
                    - object
                        - the object that it acts on: 
                            - spoon: liquid
                            - washing machine: clothes
                            - A/C: air
                        - if we consider it as an end device in the situation, then no object
                            - apps
                            - clothes when washing
                            - foods when cooking
                    - waste: wastes that the tool produces and need to clean
                2. then we consider the tool
                    - functionality
                    - interface
            - [ ] chain: A -> B -> C -> D
                - A is the dep of B
                - B is the object of A
        - [ ] body of a system
            - mind: main point of the system

                - purpose
                - when
                - where
            - **body: In this knowledge model, for the body we mainly consider the management of the components NOT the components.**
                - ~~simple systems might not have a manager, but are components connected, some of which have interfaces to outside~~
                    - a flow of force transfer
                - ~~complex systems usually have a top individual manager which provides interfaces to outside.~~ OUTDATED
    - [ ] problem solving
        - [ ] unit test
            - BLACK BOX TEST: in an unit test to a system, we not only test the manager, but all things involved in the system to achieve the test result.
            - if a system is problematic, we then dive inside
                - **note: during identify its components, we need to consider the manager if it exists.**
