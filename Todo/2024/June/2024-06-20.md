        - [x] the desserts have whole salty duck eggs
            - case
                - EGG GOAL: I mainly want the flavor and texture of salty duck eggs.
                - JUMP: I focus on the low price, and take it for granted that it contains eggs, then buy this product.
                - NO REAL EGGS: When tasting I found that the desserts do not contain real duck eggs.
                - MISLEADING ADS: It says that duck eggs are changed from a dry and hard texture to a soft one, but does not mention that it is not egg.
                - A SMALL PORTION: According to the component list, it is made of 15.8% eggs and mainly other ingredients.
                - WASTE MONEY: this purchase wasted me 12.06 RMB.
