        - [x] Chrome in phone
            - case
                - The restriction period starts at 1:30 am, but I found a backdoor for Chrome at picture-in-picture.
                - This backdoor let me watch videos till 3 am.
            - thought
                - [x] PIP: turn off it for Chrome in settings
                - [x] reenable PIP in settings: block Settings via BlockSite -> backdoor

- [ ] **refine learning model**
    - [ ] composite tool: always use the structure model
    - [ ] cohesive tool
        - [ ] ~~choice between the state model and behavior model~~: OUT DATED
            - if the tool is mainly to get/set attributes about the object/tool, use the state model (structure) for efficient search
                - management systems
                    - android settings
                    - bitwarden vaults
                    - blocksite schedules
                - simple electronics:
                    - options as status
                    - set/get options as rules
                - products searching in shopping apps
                - menu/docs
                - android notifications
                    - app-level
            - if the tool contains various complex operations to change the state of the object, use the behavior model (interfaces)
                - commands
