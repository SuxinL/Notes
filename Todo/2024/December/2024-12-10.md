                - [x] why UnionPay requires bluetooth for transport?
                    - note: WAN is still needed. 
                    - my thought: 
                        - theory 1: (security) it uses verification code, and receiver is trusted (for official services).
                            - procedure
                                1. the receiver sends the payer the code
                                2. the payer sends back the code and its id info.
                                3. once matched, the receiver directly asked the server to do the transaction
                            - challenges
                                - traditional online QRcode can do the job, and this specialized method has no need.
                        - theory 2: (security) avoid snapshot and remote payment 
                    - proof
                        - 3rd-party: theory 2 is more possible
                - [x] why wechat pay does not require bluetooth?
                    - my thought: it uses encrypted code, and both sides are under check
                        1. the payer generates the code, and sends it to the receiver.
                        2. receiver sends it to the wechat server.
                        3. if the code from the receiver is verified being generated by the payer, then it means that the payer agrees to pay to the receiver, and the server will do the transaction.
