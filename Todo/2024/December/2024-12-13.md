                - VSCODE_KEYBOARD_SHORTCUT_EDITOR: to find a keybinding, we can navigate by vs -> extensions -> the extension -> commands -> command -> keybinding, or vs -> keybinding editor -> keybinding
                - NOTES: record the most important in notes for later quick retrieve rather than rereading books.
                - CHROME_BOOKMARKS: bookmark useful sites that I need to revisit later rather than researching and spotting the one.

                    1. COMPLEX_STRUCTURE: the system is large and complex.

                    1. SHORTCUT: **only for things that I commonly use and am familiar with.**
                        1. MY_RECORDS: If I maintain records about the target, search the outside record system.
