                                                    - BALANCE: balance efficiency and security
                                                    - TYPES
                                                        - OPENED_CONTAINERS: these containers are opened, but they are at their original locations like the cupboard.
                                                        - MOVED_OUT: these objects are moved out.
                                                            - REUSABLE
                                                                - TOOLS
                                                                - MOVED_OUT_CONTAINERS: these containers are moved out
                                                                    - PURPOSE
                                                                        - EFFICIENCY
                                                                            - MULTIPLE_ITEMS: we need to use multiple items inside, so just carry the whole container, like a tool box.
                                                                        - SECURITY
                                                                            - SENSITIVE_ITEMS: items inside are sensitive, like the powder in the bag.
                                                                            - FAILURE_RETRY: It is hard to predict how many I need due to failure risk, like the whole tape roll.
                                                            - ONE_TIME_USE: consuming stuff.
                                                - PROCEDURE
                                                    - ONE_TIME_USE: if the moved out ONLY contains one-time-use stuff,
                                                        - ONE_TIME_NOW: close OPENED_CONTAINERS immediately after moving out.
                                                    - REUSABLE: if the moved out contains reusable stuff,
                                                        - PRIVATE_AND_SHORT: if OPENED_CONTAINERS are in a private place, and these REUSABLE stuff can be moved back in 5 minutes,
                                                            - ONE_TIME_LATER: close OPENED_CONTAINERS after the reusable stuff are restored.
                                                        - OTHERS: we need to close OPENED_CONTAINERS 2 times.
                                                            1. AFTER_OUT:close them after moving out.
                                                            2. AFTER_IN: reopen and close when restoring.
