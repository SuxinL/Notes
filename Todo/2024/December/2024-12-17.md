                            - nothing is perfect, whether the new ones or mine.

            - options
                - candidates
                    1. follow previous method
                    2. finish pending tasks before adding news
                    3. analyze the problem systematically before finishing tasks
                - comparison
                    1. the worst, the problem will get worse and worse. **Currently, even the thinking part which is the most 
                        important has many pending tasks.** I need to change.
                    2. this is the treatment to the problem in a traditional problem solving. Then option 2 is essentially a part of
                        option 3.
                    3. I have the skill, and I can do it.
