- [ ] self regulation

        - [ ] I resume the old routine
            - CASE
                1. FEAR_TO_THINK: At start I feared to think, because this is a complex and unfamiliar topic (Sun). 
                2. ANALYZE_PENDING_TASK_PROBLEM: After analyzing the problem of many pending tasks, I thought that I really need to come up with a new method.
                3. AUTHY_AS_OFFSET: The problem solving cost 2 whole days (Mon & Tue), and I did not do anything else. Then I learned Authy during which I encountered problems, and the learning cost me 1 whole day (Tue night ~ Win).
                4. MORE_PENDING: But there are more and more pending ones when I pause the routine, and I feel anxious (Win night).
                5. ORIGINAL: As a result, I want to firstly finish some of the most important tasks of thinking and self regulation, then to think of the task management task. (Tur)
                6. NOT_START: In fact, **I have not really started to think the new method till Fri.** even if the problem solving at step 2 gave me motivation at that moment.

                    - the think of task management is a *thinking* process.
                    - treat it as a normal thinking process in my routine.
                    - **After** I have a new plan (task management procedure) out of the process, my routine changes.
