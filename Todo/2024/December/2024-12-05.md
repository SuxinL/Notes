                - *TREATMENT & PREVENTION*
                    - CASE  
                        - REMOVE_URINE_SPOT: The act of removing urine spots on the floor is 
                            - a treatment to the current result (spots) of a past behavior (I pee on the floor)
                            - a prevention to a future process (urine particles evaporate) and its result (urine order in room)
                    - THOUGHT
                        - PHILOSOPHY
                            - PAST_AND_NOW
                                - PAST 
                                    - CAN_NOT_CHANGE: we cannot change past. If a problem has happened, it is here, and we can not change its past causes to make it not happen at present. **I need to face and solve the problem.**
                                - NOW
                                    - CAN_CHANGE: As to any factor (problem result or any of its cause),
                                        1. TREATMENT: I can handle the factor.
                                            - DISAPPEAR_IN_THE_FUTURE: The goal of this treatment is to make the factor disappear in the future. 
                                            - TREATMENT_IS_PREVENTION: The treatment of a factor is also THE PREVENTION OF ITS FUTURAL BAD RESULT.
                                        2. PREVENTION: I can handle its causes to prevent the factor from repeating in the future. Notice that these cause objects ARE AT PRESENT AND TOUCHABLE, THEN HANDLING THEM CAN NOT CHANGE THE CURRENT FACTOR BUT THE FUTURAL ONE.

                                | Aspect | early phase | later phase |
                                | --- | --- | --- |
                                | develop | slow | fast |
                                | condition | mild | severe |
                        - SOLUTION_ORDER: backwards for efficiency
                            - CONDITION: when handling a factor
                                - RESULT_HANDLED: I have already handled its result (the result has not happened OR has been solved).
                                - EXISTING: the factor is existing at the time.
                            1. START_FROM_CURRENT_PHASE: start from handling factors in the current phase.
                            2. LATER_FACTOR: The condition is severe, and saving time is limited.
                            3. EARLY_FACTOR: We still need to handle early causes, which can slow or prevent the development of the case for long with a little cost. Handling root causes well can even prevent the problem forever -> life saving.
