- [ ] self regulation: impatience
    - [x] finding how to use the smart card reader
    - [ ] handling unexpected tasks
        1. overcome amygdala hijacking: This task breaks a stable system, so it is reasonable that I feel uncomfortable.
        2. test
            1. specify and divide the goal
            2. plan the pathes
            3. estimate the cost needed
            4. think how to allocate time for it.

        - start from the final effect: pain
        - **for any factor: localization + solution together**
        - from the local factor, track backwards
- [ ] **thinking in trouble shooting**
    - [ ] localization: If the result could be the **side effect** of different individual **actions** happened.
        - If we notice the result immediately after one of the actions, this one is the most possible factor.
        - Else if we can measure how long the result has been existing, we can find the action happening at that time.
        - Else use negative unit tests for each one. (time-consuming)
    - [ ] recall actions
        - If we have records, it is good. For instance, the log system of a machine records all main events that happened in the system.
        - Other, recall by memory which is unreliable.

        - cause
            - the manual says that it can be.
        - tests
            - state
                - unbox the laptop and check the component: checked
                - **some pics of the same model online do not have this plastic blocking piece.**
        - effects
            - the slot is block by a plastic piece which is hard to remove by physical force.
