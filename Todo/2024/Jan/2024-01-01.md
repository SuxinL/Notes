                        - Problem: I did not find the docs by the method of structure.
                            - I searched in wrong places.
                                - I had a wrong assumption that the official site has a doc center.
                                    - start: I had not know the main structure of the site.
                                    - rule: Many tech sites have a doc center.
                        - Solutions
                            - test: **check the main structure of the site firstly.**

                    - [x] Main structure
                        - Problem: I forget the TOC of these docs.
                            - I did **not** build a clear model in my brain in the first place
                            - I have not touched these docs for almost 1 year.
                        - Thoughts
                            - Q: Should I remember the main structure(TOC) of an article or a book?

                                No. 
                                
                                I maintain the main structure of some knowledge in brain to
                                - quickly find the points which can be applied to the current situation.
                                - easily extend or adjust the structure to refine the knowledge.
                                
                                Books or articles are **NOT** knowledge, but **interpretations** of knowledge. We need the TOCs
                                - when we learn from the material the first time to build the learning road map.
                                - to quickly find what we want later on when memory fails.
                                In another word, only when we need to refer to a book to refine our knowledge model, we need its TOC.

                                We might read many books in our lives, then remembering the TOC of each book is costing and unnecessary. Remembering the TOC of a book enables us to find what we want more quickly. But TOC is light weight, then understanding it just costs a little time. **META: Try to understand the pattern of TOCs for a type of books.**

                                - Even though there are ports with almost identical out appearance of rectangular shapes, i.e, USB A ports, they can belong to different versions of USB, and have different data transfer speeds.
                                    - I might not transfer data efficiently like plugging a USB 3 cable into a USB 2 port on the laptop.
                        - Ignorance of port form factors 
                            - problem: I was totally unconscious of the concept of form factors when using cables before.
