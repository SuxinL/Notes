                        - case
                            - leaking compression bags can be also used to store clothes.
                                - large holes
                                    - more durable than plastic bags.
                                - tiny holes
                                    - save space(main goal): tiny holes -> leak slowly -> compress it and put it into a space before it inflates greatly.
                                    - block cockroaches: cockroaches can not crawl through these holes
                                - HARD TO REPAIR: from my test, these holes are hard to patch completely to block air.

                            - LESS_GOOD: when I find one in less good condition (small broken)
                                - REPAIR: try to repair it
                                - RELEVANT_CASE: when it is hard to repair it to meet my main goal, I can still use it maybe for a relevant case in the comparison.

                        - spread gems: they live in dark and dirty space, then it is likely that they carry gems.
                        - if they eat wood, they will damage furniture and house structure.
