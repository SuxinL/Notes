                            - problem: Installing a XAPK package failed.
                            - my model: system: installer - package
                            - realize: the installer does not install the package directly, but the process involves Android OS.

                                - FAMILIAR: For a familiar case, I use the flow as the system directly.
                                - UNFAMILIAR: For general cases,
                                    - GENERAL_TOP_LEVEL: start from a general range in which I am sure that the problem exists, and localize the problem.

                                        - FLOW_AFTER_UNDERSTAND: construct the flow after I understand the system well and list all involved components.
