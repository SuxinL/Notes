- [ ] thinking
    - [ ] *divide & conquer*
        - case
            - move
                - the bag of breads is too large to fit the rack: divide breads into 2 bags
                - moving a large furniture through a door: disassemble  
            - clean
                - the internal of a clip is hard to clean: disassemble the clip
        - think
            - INITIAL_ATOMIC_GOAL: It is an atomic goal involving one simple physical operation initially. 
            - CONSTRAINTS: But there are constraints making handling the object as a whole difficult.
                - LARGE_SIZE: The object is too large to move easily.
                    - SPACE_LIMIT 
                        - PASSWAY
                        - STORE  
                    - TOO_MUCH_FORCE: It takes too much force to lift or move it.
                - COMPLEX_STRUCTURE: hard to clean corners.
            - DIVIDE & CONQUER
                - PRINCIPLES
                    - STRUCTURE
                    - INFINITE_DIVISION
                - PROCEDURE
                    - DIVIDE: if I face these constraints, divide the object into parts based on its structure. Otherwise handle it as a normal atomic goal.
                    - CONQUER: handle parts with the same procedure recursively one by one.
                    - COMBINE: assemble parts.
