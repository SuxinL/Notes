                    - learning purpose:
                        - user level
                            - use a system
                        - structure level
                            - problem solving
                            - inspiration
                    - SCOPE
                        - TOO LARGE: 
                            - UNUSED_MEMORY: many unused branches, about which memory will fade quickly.
                        - TOO SMALL:
                            - LESS_INFORMED: 
                                - NO_OPTIONS: hard to consider other options for a similar purpose.
                                - WRONG_TYPE: maybe I use a wrong-type product.
                            - NO_KNOWLEDGE_BASE: 
                                - LEARNING: it might start from ground to learn another type of products
                                - PROBLEM_SOLVING: not general enough to solve a group of problems
                    - SOLUTION
                        1. TOP_LEVEL
                            - CHOOSE: if we plan to choose a tool for a purpose, 
                                - GOAL: start from the general purpose like *room cooler*
                            - GIVEN: if we are given a tool, we already know its general purposes. 
                                - MAIN_MECHANISM: In this case, we start from a general system with the same working mechanism. For example, if we have a rotating-grille box fan, we start from system *fan* which uses a motor to turn vanes to produce breeze. 
                        2. SUBTYPES
                            - GOAL_SPECIFICATION: each subtype differs from others in some aspects of the goal (use case) 
                            - MAIN_POINTS: for each subtype, we learn its main points.
                            - DIVE: we dive into a subtype when 
                                - it meets our specific use case 
                                - OR it covers the given system.
                        3. TARGET_SYSTEM: learn it comprehensively with the general knowledge model.
