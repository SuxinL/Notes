                    - goal: I need a rack to place living items
                    - my plan:
                        - make: I do not have needed boards and frames.
                        - buy: so I decide to buy one.
                        - price: but those are expensive.
                    - new idea: Zhou suggests the shoe rack which I find enough for the use after testing.

                                - ALTERNATIVE: we already have objects meeting our needs:
