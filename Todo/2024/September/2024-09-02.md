                            - ENGINEERING: But in engineering where things are well organized, a problem is usually caused by a single factor. Then we can use unit test.
                                - INTERFACE V.S CONNECTOR: 
                                    - INTERFACE PROBLEM: In a problem of an specific interface, the components are generally working which means they work when connecting with other devices respectively.
                                    - CONNECTOR PROBLEM: if a connector is problematic like being deformed or the circuit broken, then it will not work even connecting to other devices. **Then it is a problem of the component containing the connector not the interface.** 
                                - NO_BLACK_BOX_UNIT_TEST: we can not unit test an interface out of box. It is not an individual physical object but a concept from the connection of two physical connectors.
                                - SPECIFICATION: Instead, we specification the problem of an interface to difference sub factors, then test these factors in the following order.
                                    1. MISMATCH: The problem exists from the beginning.
                                    2. LOOSE: ever worked, but problematic now.
                                        1. PHYSICAL_PROBLEM: 
                                            - HANDLE_THEN_TEST: we clean the connectors or tighten the connection especially when there are visible sights of dirts or shaking connection. If the problem disappears then this is the cause. Otherwise not.
                                            - **CONNECTOR_LOOSE**: If the connection is still loose after tightening, then 
                                                - this loose connection is a problem of the connectors not the interface
                                                - this loose connection might NOT cause our target problem
                                                In this case, we need to test the connectors **during handling the components but NOT NOW**.
                                        2. BLOCK: 
                                            - EFFECT: It is hard to unit test it directly. It is an effect of actions from rules not a physical object.
                                            - TEST_OTHERS_FIRST: When we rule out all above factors, we can firstly unit test other interfaces and components.
                                                - if others are all fine, then this is the factor, and we need to check the rules afterwards.
                                                - otherwise not.
