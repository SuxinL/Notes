                        - BUILD_MODEL: build a **general** model for tools of same types.
                        - FIND_ISSUES: record uncertain points
                    - HOW
                        1. THINK: think by myself. Based on the purposes of the tool, think about its structure as if I was the designer.
                        2. USE: try the tool to to refine my model. 
                2. ACT
                    - ADJUST_MODEL: learn from others to adjust my composed model.
                    - ISSUE_HANDLE: for each uncertain issues
                        1. THINK: critical thinking by myself
                        2. LEARN: learn from others
                        3. TEST: if learning materials are not found, we need to try the tool on the issue.

                - [ ] I did not find the user guide online.
                - [ ] try to dissemble by brute force without knowing its structure -> I almost damaged a bear ring.
            - [ ] learning procedure after encountering a problem.
                1. reasoning: based on my knowledge, I reason that it is a bolt from its appearance and function.
                2. problem: I found an unit similar to a nut, but 
                    - I could not remove it by turning it.
                    - its shape is strange
                        - not a complete ring, having an opening
                        - a thin piece
                3. test: I tried different methods, and eventually I succeeded. I found that it is a catcher to the bolt which should be inserted sideways.
                    - But I almost broken a rubber bear ring.
            - [ ] no prevention solutions: I acted before finishing the problem solving process.
