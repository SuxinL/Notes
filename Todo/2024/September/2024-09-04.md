                    - I-TOOL: I do not know the tool enough.
                    - TOOL: It really does not have the functionality.
                - test
                    - learn from others: refined search method
                    - by myself: test behaviors
            2. EXTENDED_PLAN: if the tool really does not have the functionalities
                - ORGANIZE: try other tools
            3. HYBRID_SOLUTION: if a tool can only meet some parts of our goal, combine them.

            - [x] how an installer gets the certificate when installing an app the first time?
                - my theory
                    1. the certificate is included in the APK
                        pros:
                            - no extra dep
                    2. use the developer id to get it from some trusted sources like google
                        pros:
                            - smaller APK size
                    3. enable installation without verification
                - android official
                    - the apk includes the certificate which is a must.
