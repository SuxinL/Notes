                1. STATIC CHECK: check its static state
                    - miss
                    - deformed
                    - **on/off**
                2. UNIT TEST: if we can NOT determine whether or not a factor is problematic from static checking: use unit test to test behaviors.
                3. LOCALIZATION: if we find that it is problematic eventually: we then decide whether to localize further.
            - localization for system level problem
                - if we find that the problem is at the system level affecting all its sub systems: we do not localize based on functionalities, but directly dive into implementation components supporting the whole system.
    - [ ] *seek VScode markdown keyboard shortcut to delete list heads*
        1. search official doc of MD all-in-one
            1. JUMP: At the beginning, I jumped to a conclusion that this extension has this shortcut.
                - think: organize all options
                    - built-in
                    - extensions
                        - MD all-in-one
            2. NO_IN_DETAILS: I did not find it in the DETAILS part, but there is not additional user guide, and the DETAILS part does not mention that there are additional bindings.
                - think: handle the search problem: I_AND_SYS
                    - ~~I~~: I search by structure
                    - I_AND_SYS
                        - MISMATCH

                                    - ONLY_DETAILS_PART: I only search this part. This part should contain the info, but It does not. As to **OTHERS' SYSTEMS**, I should move to upper levels and search other parts.
                        - ~~LOOSE~~: not succeed ever.
                    - SYS
                        - DETAILS
                            - NO_MENTION_ADDITIONAL_KEYBINDINGS: the details part says that the keybinding list is full, but actually there are some not mentioned.
            3. MORE_SHORTCUTS_IN_FEATURE_CONTRIBUTIONS:
                1. I found shortcuts not mentioned in the DETAILS part.
                2. and commands without keybindings.
                3. but no command that declares to achieve my goal.
            4. TRY
                1. the keybinding most related is `Backspace`. I know that if press it when the cursor is after
                    - an list head `- `, the head indents backwards.
                    - an task list head `- [ ] `, the brackets part is deleted and the head becomes `- `.
                2. when trying different handling mechanisms, I found that if the cursor is immediately following the head symbol and there is no space in between, one character is deleted, then it requires at least 2 steps to delete a list head.
                3. PREVENTION: I later one found that `shift + enter` can start a new line without a list head.
                - think: TEST BY MYSELF: when a tool is poorly documented, I need to **test** by myself and make a theory.
        2. search vscode official doc
            1. NO_IN_MARKDOWN: 
                1. GOAL_ORIENTATION_FAILED: The markdown section itself does not mention list handling.
                2. JUMP: I jumped to a conclusion that VSCode MD built-in support does not special treatment to lists.
                    - think: 
                        - test: test is the best method to overcome jump and bias. 
                            - no mention: notice that this section just does not mention lists, but not say that vscode does not have the support.
                            - **test by myself**: recall the risk of fake results of test by others
                        - recall vscode knowledge:
                            - command
                                - a command is a service to achieve some goal
                                - vscode and extensions change the state of a project via commands that they provide by themselves
                                - command palette: a manager to access all available commands
                            - keybinding
                                - for commonly used commands, there is usually a keybinding for each.
                                - there is also a centralized manager for all keybindings. 
            2. KEYBINDING_REF
                1. CROSS_SLICE: I was not satisfied. I made a theory that the doc might have a whole keybinding section. I deducted this from the fact that vscode has a centralized command manager and a keybinding manager.
                2. REF: I found this ref sheet in the keyboard section.
                3. NOT_CONTAIN: but it does not mention lists.
                    - think: 
                        - test by myself
                            - WHEN: if **it failed to learn from others**, I have to test by myself.
                            - HOW: to find all built-in commands for MD, I need to search the command palette   
        3. use keybinding trouble shooting in VSCode
            1. TRY: During trying, I found accidentally that `ctrl + backspace` can delete an unordered list head.
            2. KEYBINDING_TROUBLE_SHOOTING: Using this program, I found that this keybinding is from built-in.
        4. testing
            1. INADEQUATE: `ctrl + backspace` will delete the left word by design. So it can delete an unordered head, but not an ordered one.
            - think: 
                - general solution: a general command might can do this specific work
                - reality principle: it is less efficient, but works. 
            1. **current best solution of combining built-in and this extension**
                - prevention
                    - start a new line with indentation but no list head: `shift + enter`
                - treatment
                    - delete
                        - `- `: `ctrl + backspace`
                        - `- [ ] `: `backspace`, `ctrl + backspace`
                        - `1. `: `ctrl + backspace`, `ctrl + backspace`
                    - replace
                        1. delete
                        2. add
