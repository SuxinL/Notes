            - BRUTE_TRY: I tend to try again and again
                - when an error of a conflicting signature pops during updating BlockSite
                - when the FB app is not usable but Meituan is while the VPN shows being connected.
            - INSENSITIVE: Even if I fail many times, I still retry without realizing and analyzing the problem.
            - TIME_WASTED: I wasted a lot of time in the end before starting to thinking of the problem.
