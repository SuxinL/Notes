                    - purpose: 
                        - efficiency
                            - reduce repeated open/close
                        - security
                            - reduce the duration when the container is open
                    - strategy
                        - When considering the PATH,
                            - REUSABLE: we need to restore things afterwards due to taking reusable objects out
                                - inner containers
                                - tools

                                - QUICK_PERSONAL: IF we can finish the task in 5 mins AND we are in a personal space
                                    - ONCE_LATER: we close containers during the CLEAN phase.
                                - ELSE: 
                                    - TWICE: we close containers when moving the target out, which also means we need to reopen and close containers later.
                            - ONE_TIME_USE: we only take out one-time-use objects
                                - consuming things
                                - one-time-use packaging
                                in this case
                                - ONCE_NOW: we close containers when moving the target out.
