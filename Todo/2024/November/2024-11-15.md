                    - check not uploaded
        - [x] album oriented V.S storage oriented
            | Aspect | Album | Storage |
            | --- | --- | --- |
            | fine grain management | hard: one-level album -> repeated prefix & plan before creating albums  | easy: tree -> shared parent dir & specify recursively |
            | album display | easy | hard: albums and dirs are NOT bound --> need to create an album for each leaf dir manually. |
            | upload photo | easy | hard: Not bound -> need to update both the dir and the album |
            | divide album | middle: create new albums | hard: divide the dir then create new albums |
            | check not uploaded | easy: the APP can detect them | easy |
