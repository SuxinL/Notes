                - ADDING_FAILURE: When adding a large group of photos in a dir to an album, an error message popped up showing this operation failed.
                - JUMP: I did not analyze the problem systematically. I noticed that only when adding more than 200 photos at once this problem pops, then I jump to a conclusion that an album can only contain at most 200 photos.
                - DIVIDE_DIR: Then I divided dirs with more than 200 photos into smaller ones.
                - LARGE_ALBUM_EXIST: Later on I found that I already had albums with more than 200 photos.
