        - [ ] *MEMORY_LOSS*: handle memory loss in which I can not recall a point.
            1. SEARCH_BY_STRUCTURE: try to locate the point in a top-down approach.
            2. THINK_BY_MYSELF: think as if I were the designer
                - OBJECT: what it would be based on its goals.
                - PROCEDURE: what I would do to achieve the goal.
            3. TEST: compare my idea with other resources and refine it.
            4. COMBINE_INTO_MODEL: add the refined point to my existing knowledge model
