                - humidity is a measure of how much water vapor in the air.
                    - absolute humidity
                        - a measure of how much water vapor in the air at any one time ($g/m^3$) 
                    - relative humidity
                        - the ratio of the volume of current water vapor to the maximal that the air can hold at that time. (%)
                            $$RH = \frac{current \space vapor \space density}{saturation \space vapor \space density}$$

                - security
                    - high humidity (> 60%)

                    - temperature
                        - Temperature can change the saturation vapor density. The higher the temperature, the more water vapor the air can hold.
