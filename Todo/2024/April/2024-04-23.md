    - [ ] impatience in searching for Chrome extensions
        - case
            - I need to save web pages as pdf files with TOC, but Chrome builtin printer does not have this functionality.
            - There are many pdf related extensions on the web store.
            - I try many only from their names, not checking introductions firstly.
            - most of what I tried are not what I want.
            - Eventually I find 2 working.
                - One provides good outlook but is only free for 1 year.
                - The other is free, but the generated docs are ugly.
            - I test the 2 without learning from manuals, then I experience many failures and waste much time.

            - [x] reluctance to check overviews
                - [x] a tired body: have a rest 
                - [x] temptation to try directly: notice the benefits of checking overview at first
                    - incremental investment: the cost of reading the overview is less than downloading and testing it then finding it not working.
                    - one-time investment: learning how to check Chrome extension pages will help to search for extensions efficiently in the future.
            - [ ] skip manuals: to test it
                - [ ] firstly check the overview to see whether the functionality is supported.
                - if not mentioned, I need to take the risk of testing it directly by myself.
                    - notice that learning by doing takes time and is NOT a first-line method.
