        - [x] Chinese dubbed version of the Japanese movie sounds worse than the original.
            - case
                - cause
                    - general
                        - Japanese sounds special and matches comics well.
                        - Chinese, especially northern accents sound rude and embarrassing.
                    - specific
                        - I have not found trailers in Chinese.
                        - The natural voices of those dubbing agents sound not fittable.
            - fact
                - test: The Chinese dubbed version is good.
            - solution
                - test: the test in this case is costing, so we should use incremental strategy.
                    - trailers if available
                    - the movie
                        - intervention: if not good, I can switch to another room.
        - [x] The beverage powder is bad.
            - case
                - The first time I tried it, it tasted sour but with little fruit flavor.
                - I then tried to add sugar and cool it, but it did not taste better.
                - **The second time I dissolved the powder with less water, it then tasted good meeting my requirement.**
            - thoughts
                - problem solving: In a human involving process, if the result is not good, it can be due to
                    1. the object: not good
                    2. the interface: the person does not handle it the right way.
                    In this case, the problem is the interface.

        - [x] Phones have memories but no disks nowadays.
            - case

                    - From my experience, the size of memories of laptops are usually between 4 GB and 16 GB, and that of disks are usually between 256 GB and 1T.
                    - Years ago, some seller told me that the memory of a phone is 128 GB, then I thought that in phones memories and disks are the same thing.
                    - But recently when I check the storage of a phone, I found that its memory is 8 GB and its disk is 128 GB!

        - [x] I need to follow the lessons one by one, and can not skip some.
            - case
                - state: I see a lock icon on lessons that I have not taken.
                - rule: lock icons of missions in games usually mean that I need to complete these mission one by one.
                - conclusion: this rule applies to the lessons of typing. 
            - thought
                - another reasoning
                    - for experienced students, the platform should allow them to jump to their focus.
                - test
                    - I can skip: When I choose a locked course, It gives me the option to start it with a suggestion that It it better to follow the roadmap.
