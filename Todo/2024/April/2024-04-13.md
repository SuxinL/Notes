- [ ] self regulation
    - [ ] give in to Gomoku
        - case
            - I downloaded a Gomoku app in the Ipad and played it for 2 hours.
            - Even if the user experience is terrible in which there are many ads, I am still willing to play it.
            - Eventually, Zhou's angry face let me cool my mind.
        - thought
            - [ ] Gomoku in the Ipad: uninstall & block it
                - [ ] Block keywords via BlockSite
                    - `五子棋`
                    - `gomoku`
                    - `snooker`
                - [ ] Ban new installations: set App store installation password
            - Zhou's supervision worked.
            - self regulation failed: I lack self control currently.
