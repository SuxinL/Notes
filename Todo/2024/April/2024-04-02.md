- [x] self regulation
    - [x] impatient in deciding the best position to install the back ring
        - case
            - I had installed a back ring on my phone, but I had not tested it. Then I started to install back rings for Zhou.
            - later on when I used it, I found that the position that enables 
                - the thumb at the middle of the screen when relaxing
                - the middle finger to support the ring 
                achieves the optimal balance.
                - my thumb then can reach the top line and bottom line with the same effort.
                    - top line
                        - app icons
                        - TOC
                        - notification drawer 
                    - bottom line
                        - home buttons
                        - keyboard
                - the middle finger provides the largest supporting force.
            - Surprising, I installed it at the optimal location by accident.
        - solution
            - reality principle: not perfect, but good.
            - learned lesson
                - **install rings at the location where the right index finger is at the middle of a phone when the right middle finger wears the ring.**
            - practice being patient.
                - fully test one before applying the rest.

                | Aspect | Viruses | Bacteria | Fungi |
                | --- | --- | --- | --- |
                | Size(micrometers) | 0.025 ~ 0.35 | 0.3 ~ 5 | 3 ~ 10 |
                | Structure | Simple. A virus has genome which can be DNA or RNA in a protein capsule. | Complex. Bacteria have genome surrounded by a cell wall, and many types of bacteria have flagella which enable them to move independently. | In contract to viruses and bacteria, A fungus have a nucleus and other cell elements. |
                | Habitats | They can survive on surfaces for weeks, but hosts are needed for long-term survival. | Everywhere including the air, water, foods or bodies. | Molds like damp environments. |
                | Reproduction | After viruses enter a host, they attach on cells and inject their genome into these cells. The genome replicate and viruses multiply inside host cells which eventually break apart. | Unlike viruses which are not counted as living, bacteria are unicellular living organisms. They metabolite and reproduce by cell division. | 1. cell division 2. spores |
                | Hazards | Viruses destroy host cells. | Bacteria produce toxins during metabolism. | 1. respiratory irritation 2. allergies 3. mycotoxins|
