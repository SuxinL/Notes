            - case
                - State
                    - At the first floor there is a buffet.
                - Rule
                    - priority first: most visited restaurants are the nearest in distance.
                    - experience: At my university, there are usually cheap buffets at the 1st floor, and other more tasty but more expensive options at upper floors.
                - conclusion
                    - individual restaurants at the 2nd and 3rd floors.
            - thought
                - test
                    - there is a larger buffet with much more dishes.
                - causes
                    - this arrangement also makes sense.
                    - In the buffet at the 2nd floor, students pick the types and amounts of dishes that they want, and servers weigh eventually, which requires a high hygiene.
