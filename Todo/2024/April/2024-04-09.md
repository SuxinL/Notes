- [x] self regulation
    - [x] jump to conclusions
        - [x] BlockSite does not fix these bugs in the latest version.
            - case
                - I encountered 2 problems in using BlockSite app.
                    1. Disabling a schedule group is not working
                    2. Blocking Chinese keywords is not working
                - I used problem solving skills
                    1. The only way to disable a group is to toggle off the switch -> so the problem is inside the app itself.
                    2. hard
                        - The BlockSite official site does not specify the format and allowed chars for keywords.
                            - I tried
                                - raw Chinese
                                - percent-encoded octets
                                both not working
                            - leechblock supports percent-encoded octets.
                        - I assumed that the problem is the app, then I tried to find alternatives.
                            - AppBlock
                                - support Chinese
                                - but not stable to block pages
                            - Freedom
                                - login is mandated, then I can not use a mod version.
                        - Last, I tried a new version of BlockSite, and it has fixed these problems.
            - thought
                - test
                    - before: Can I find its update log?
                    - risk: Will the data be overridden?
                        - cause
                            - yes
                                - if the installer sees the app as a whole
                            - no
                                - for good module design
                        - test
                            - by myself(risky): no for BlockSite
                            - by others
                                - views: no
