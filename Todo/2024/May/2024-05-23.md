                - LATE_LOW_SELF_CONTROL: I plan to play phone from 1 am to 2 am, but eventually I play from 1 am to 4 am.
                - At 2:30 am, I felt nothing to play because most video and entertainment sites are blocked by schedule.
                - TWITTER: But at that time , I did not want to sleep and I turned to twitter for adult contents for 1 hour.

- [x] thaw frozen meat quickly
    - [x] in the air: too slow, almost no changes after 5 mins
    - [x] hot pot
        - cause
            - high power + oil for heat transfer -> enough
        - test
            - bad after cooking 5 mins
                - surface charred
                - inside still frozen
    - [x] boiling water
        - test the time needed: 10 mins
        - concern: bacteria growth
            - cause: high temperature promotes growth
                - danger zone: 4.5 ~ 60.C
                - boiling water near 100.C is then safe to thaw.
            - test
                - temp: 100.C

            - [ ] outside charred, inside still frozen
                - my theory:
                    - theory:
                        - **frozen meats** have a **low conduction rate**
                        - if we put a frozen chicken breast directly on a heated pan, then the high heat mainly accumulates on its surface, which chars the surface whereas there is no enough heat arriving the core.
                    - test: right!
                        - not frozen: 0.5
                        - frozen: 0.05
                - theory 2: less thermal gradation means more evenly cooked meat.
            - [ ] when will food be charred?
                - meat
                    - frozen
                    - large fire
                - pancake 
                    - no oil
                    - large fire
            - [ ] defrosting with hot water is faster than with cold water even if the water is above 0.C all the time.
                - my theory: the **temperature difference** between the 2 contacting objects also after the conduction rate.
