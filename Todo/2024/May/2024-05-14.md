- [ ] thinking
    - [x] assembling a system
        - when there are different ways to install something like directions and sides,
            - cause: reason from the structure of components in order to reduce risk and cost
            - test: sometimes there are many factors to consider when reasoning, and test will tell us whether a way is correct.
                - some factors might be out of our knowledge
                - some factors might need precise calculation to determine
            - shortcut: (test by others) if how to install is not important to us and there are references, we can just mimic them.
    - [x] solid wastes remain in body for long but they are of light color and the defecation is NOT painful.
        - case
            - I suffer from constipation after eating instant noodles.
            - When eating vegetables frequently, I defecate each day.
            - Recently I also eat foods high of fibers like vegetables and oatmeal, but my freq of defecation decreases to 3 times a week. **But not like the case of instant noodles, defecation is smooth.**

                - what we eat determines the color of poop.
                - If the color is dark, freq is low, experience is painful.
                - if the color is light, experience is smooth.
