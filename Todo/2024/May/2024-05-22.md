            - case
                - I planed to play phone for 1 hour, and started to sleep at 2 am.
                - But eventually I slept from 5 am.
                - In these 4 hours, I mostly watched videos.
                    - youku
                    - youtube
                    - mangotv
                - I have set schedules for these by BlockSite, but it has a backdoor that when an app is blocked, switching to running app page then switching back to the blocked app enables the unblocked page present until some operations or a few seconds pass. By this method, I can still use the app with some overhead.
                - This backdoor even enables me to turn off accessibility of Blocksite, which makes the app not working.
            - thought
                - [x] strict use limits (1 hour each day for each app, between 21 pm and 2 am)
                    - [x] ~~**localization**~~: parental modes inside apps
                        - youku, mangotv: not configurable
                    - [x] Android app use limit: can only set limits to 1h
                    - [x] BlockSite: set schedules: allow access from 21 pm to 2 am each day
                - [x] ~~fix backdoor~~: use Android privacy password to block Android settings
                    - to restrict accesses to credential users, no time limits
                    - **Neither privacy password or app use limit can work on Settings**
