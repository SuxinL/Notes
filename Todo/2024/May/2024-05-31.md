                - I eat meal in sofa, then use Chrome and Kugou music apps.
                - After the meal, I take my phone with me to toilet.
                - After pooping, I still play phone for a while in bed.
                - I sprinkle cold water to my face to interrupt me, but it did not work.
                - When the time limit for Kugou is used up, I stop.
                - As a result, I wasted 1 hour on phone.
