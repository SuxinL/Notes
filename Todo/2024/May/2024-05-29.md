    - [ ] **the problem solving of charred chicken breast**
        - actuation: surface charred, inside still frozen
        - expectation: evenly cooked well
        - **NOTICE**
            - NOT PHYSICAL VISIBLE OR TOUCHABLE OBJECT: This is a problem about heat. Heat is energy not physical object which is invisible.
            - FURTHER SPECIFICATION: This is a problem about efficiency of the heat flow, not being on/off of it. Efficiency is not a binary situation, and quantities are required. -> formulas 
            - Dynamic process of heat is involved.
        - my past experience
            - MIMIC: people usually use heat to cook foods
            - In some cases, the food has been cooked for a long time, but inside is still raw
                - grill chicken wings (10 mins)
                - cook meats (1 min)
                - vegetables (20 s)
            - OBSERVATION: a cooking method: turn down the fire, and close the lid

                        - raw meats are hard to chew.
                    - flavor
                        - raw vegetables are a little bitter.
                    - health
                        - eating raw foods sometimes makes me have the runs
