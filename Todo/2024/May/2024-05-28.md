- [ ] self regulation
    - [x] give in to
        - [x] phone
            - case
                - I played phone late at night.
                - from 2 am to 5:30 am.
                - I watched videos
                    - youku
                    - xigua
                    - youtube
                    - weibo
                - I even disabled BlockSite for watching more videos.
                - I also watched some videos from wechat friends
            - thought
                - [x] video
                    - [x] youku: limit to 0.5 h/d
                    - [x] xigua: add the site to the video group in BlockSite
                - [x] Chrome: limit to 1.5 h/d
                - [x] turn on BlockSite
    - [ ] reluctance to
        - [ ] learn formulas
            - case
                - when learning thermal conduction, I see calculus symbols.
                - I feel anxious and reluctant to check these formulas.
            - thought
                - [ ] Ignorance
                    - [ ] calculus:
                        - [ ] TODO: Relearn it.
                    - [ ] thermal conduction formulas:
                        - [ ] test how much calculus is involved
                        - [ ] understand what I need
                            - [ ] factors
        - [x] learn and use Ofamily in OPPO
            - case
                - I had saw this term in the privacy policy of app use limit before.
                - But I felt reluctant to try it.
                - Recently I found a backdoor to turn off the limit for individual apps in the main limit page of that app.
                - Then I took a step to try the Ofamily app, then I found it work perfectly by letting another OPPO account supervise my phone app use. 
            - thought
                - [x] No pressure: this backdoor forces me to try it.
                - [x] No active action: firstly know about family link in Android from online material.
- [ ] thinking
    - [ ] **practice the general problem solving skills in real time**
        - [ ] from the final effect
        - [ ] in localization,if the system is **a thing**,
            - check whether the system has a individual manager
                - if it has, which is the common case for complex systems, see this manager as the mind
                - if not for simple system, then the mind are its general rules an properties.
            - for the body part, to save cost, try in the following order to build structure
                1. check official manuals
                2. examine the system
                    - goal orientation
                    - rule of 3
            - for systems with an individual manager, we need to additionally consider **interfaces between the manager and components**.
