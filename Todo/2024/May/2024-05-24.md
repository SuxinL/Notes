                - The Android restriction period starts at 3 am when I should go to sleep.
                - But I found that this restriction on an app can be removed without any authentication.
                - Then I turned off it and played phone till 4:30 am.
            - thought
                - [x] ~~STRONG_BLOCKING~~: set password for Android restriction period utility.
                    - no this option
                - [x] ~~SELF_CONTROL~~: weak, especially late at night when I am tired.
