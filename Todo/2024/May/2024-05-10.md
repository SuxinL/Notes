                - a mechanical device that can compress or move fluid.

                - **WRONG**: https://learnmetrics.com/how-does-a-mini-split-work/
                    - cool: to compress high-pressure gas into low-pressure liquid to squeeze heat out.
                    - heat: versa
                - 2 purposes
                - to increase the temperature of the refrigerant to be greater than ambient air, then heat can be rejected.
                - to push the flow
            - [x] Q: Why should we close windows when using A/C?
                - A/C uses a thermal sensor to detect the indoor temperature. When it reaches the target, the A/C pauses, otherwise it keeps running.

            - [x] Q: will ac make air dryer?
                - yes. The evaporator coil absorbs heat, which can condense water vapor.
