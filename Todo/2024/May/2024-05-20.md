        - specify the process with multiple steps which lead to a series of intermediate states.
            - special case: if these specific steps are about a flow of data, force or substances through multiple components, group these components and handle them together for efficiency.

            - what
                - a synthetic material which block water droplets but allow water vapor to go through.

                - theory 1: for the goal of one-way vapor penetration

                - cause
                    - production: spunbond
                        1. HDPE pellets are melten
                        2. extruded from a spin to form fibers
                        3. randomly lied on a xx by air flow
                        4. fibers bond by heat roller

                    - box 1: smooth side down, box 2: smooth side up, box 3: no tyvek

                - test 2
                    - result: tyvek can block water liquid
            - [x] how to use it? whichever side faces upwards is fine.
            - [x] **What if the condensed water evaporate and escape?** calcium chloride solution is extremely resistant to evaporation. 
            - [x] **Can CaCl2 restrict water from evaporating again?** yes
                - the solution is heavy: large mass
                - it has a large surface tension: sticky
            - [x] why CaCl2 as a desiccant clot when using?

                                - spunbond: fibers are randomly lied on a platform by air flow to avoid alignments to be tear resistant.
                                - fiber density balance: make the sheet breathable and water resistant.
            - note
                - SIDE_NOT_AFFECT: two sides of a sheet have different textures, one smoother than the other. Both placements have the same performance.
