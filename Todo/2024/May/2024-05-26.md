                        - We feel cold when heat leaves our bodies, and the speed of heat leaving determines the degree of the feeling of coldness.

                        When touch the surface of a bowl,
                        $$
                            k_s > k_c \\

                    - [ ] why frozen meats have lower conduction rate than unfrozen ones
                        - conflict: frozen meats contain ice while unfrozen ones contain water, ice is solid which molecules are fixed and easier to transfer thermal energy by collision. 
                    - [x] Why high-power fire chars the outside of meat, but leaves the inside still raw.
                        - Based on Fourier's law, supposed that $k$ of meat does not change with temperature, the larger $q$, the larger temperature gradient. So under high-power fire, if the meat is thick, then temperature difference between the surface and core could be large, so the inside of meat can be at a low temperature when the outside is very hot even charred.

                        - heat each piece(each place) evenly: the center of pan is usually the hottest place. Moving pieces between the center and surrounding area enables each piece receive same amount of heat.
