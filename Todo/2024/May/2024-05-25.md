            - case
                - Expectation: I plan to sleep at 2 am.
                - I played phone over 3 am.
                - When the restriction mode is on at 3 am, I can easily remove it without password.
                - I used up the limited time for Chrome and Youku. But Android app use limit is very powerful at limiting at app level.
                - I do not have membership of MangoTV, then this app is almost useless.
                - After that, I even tried to install Firefox to bypass the limit on Chrome. 
                - As a result, I went to sleep at 4 am, and I had a bad sleep.
            - thought
                - [x] app
                    - [x] MangoTV: uninstall
                    - [x] Chrome: limit daily use to 2 hours.
                    - [x] Restriction mode: disable it because it is useless indeed.
                - [x] sites: BlockSite is very efficient at blocking sites due to the redirecting usage.
                    - [x] entertainment sites: block from 1 am to 9 pm.
                - [x] sleep lately:
                    - [x] sticky note: sleep before 2 am.
                    - [x] practice in mind
                - [x] Firefox: 
                    - [x] set ban on installing specific apps on phone.

                                - by myself: not found
                                - by others: Ofamily: it works!
                        - [x] ~~third party tools~~: the default package installer is required. 
                    - [x] ban usage by Android app use limit once a tempting app is installed
                - [x] tempting apps
                    - [x] uninstall
                    - [x] delete package files

    - [x] jump to conclusions
        - [x] orders in Meituan are not organized by a structure
            - case
                - I thought that orders in Meituan are mainly listed in order of reversed time and only categorized by order status.
                - By accident, I found that the filters option provides a structure of types.
                - After, I found that in Taobao, the filters also provides a structure of types.
            - thought
                - [x] understand: filters are used to narrow ranges for efficient search.
                - [x] test: to determine whether or not the filters provide a structure based on types, the best method is testing.
