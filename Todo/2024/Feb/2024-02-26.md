                - method 1: catch the main structure
                    1. firstly handle main connections
                    2. then handle each part

                        - moving the whole object when installing small units costs more energy later.
                - method 2: assemble the main connections last.

                - [x] theory 1: the round-edge side should face the object 
                    - avoid stress concentration on the edge which may damage the object.
                    - easer to remove when against a flat surface.

                - theory 1: the side with a hole should be in the front
                    - cause: enabling a tilting tool to tilt the chair backwards.
                - **theory 2**: the side with a hole should be in the back
                    - effect: This side tilts down, then if it is installed facing the front, the seat will tilt frontwards, which is uncomfortable.
