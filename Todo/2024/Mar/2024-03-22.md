    - [ ] impatient in installing the kitchen water tap
        - [x] loose the stuck bolt
            - case
                - the bolt and nut not aligned
                - the nut stuck on the bolt
            - trials
                - oil to lubricant: not working
                - tools to provide large torques
                    - wrench: interface mismatched, sliding
                    - fix the bolt on the upper part of the tap, then turn the bolt while holding the nut: it can only fasten the nut further, which makes the problem more serious.
                - replacement: I contacted the seller.
                - finally, I took a risk of changing the shape of the bolt from circle to ellipse, then the wrench can catch the bolt firmly to turn it.: working, and restoring the bolt is needed.
            - solution
                - think of the risks of each step
                    - *fix the bolt on the upper part of the tap*: It takes more torque to turn a stuck nut than a normal one, then when turning the tap anticlockwise, the connection between the bolt and the tap looses before that one between the nut and the bolt.
                - localization: replacement as the last resort
            - thinking
                - **how to loose a round-shape nut.**
                    - how to catch it firmly without sliding.
                    - **test: The nut is NOT round, but hex**
        - [x] the order
            - case
                - I tried to install from top to bottom, which stuck at the last step in which tube heads at the bottom side can not pass through the nut.
                    - I connected the tap with the tubes firstly on a table because it is difficult to see the holes in the tap and insert the tubes after the tap is fixed on its target pool.
                    - Then I ignore the other end of the tubes. 
                - the instruction video does not say it clearly.
            - solution
                - disassemble and start again.
            - thinking
                - firstly check the official manual
                - installation: top-down / down-top approach not working here
                    - no well-designed modulation: integrated tubes go through the whole system.
                - a good experience: learn from mistakes
