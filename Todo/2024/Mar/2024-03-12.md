    - [x] ~~shampoo~~ spurts not flows slowly from newly bought bottles
        - testing
            - The diluted shampoo with water spurts far.
            - The bodyguard shower gel spurts far.
            - **The original header & shoulders shampoo flows slowly.** It actually works.
        - deduction: 
            - The slower I press the button, the slower the liquid spurts.
            - The thinner the liquid, the farer it spurts.
            - explanation: $a = F / m$

                - [x] Is my theory of how a lotion pump works right? parts
                    - It uses air pressure to move lotion
                    - when pressing, the downside hole is blocked by a ball.
                    - when depressing, the upside hole is blocked by a piston.
                - [x] differences between a sprayer and a streamer? 
                    - the pump parts are similar.
                    - the main difference is the structure of the nozzle.
            - [x] test
                - what
                    - A shampoo pump is a small device to pump shampoo liquid from the bottle for use.
                - purposes
                    - efficiency
                        - just press the head and no need to turn the bottle upside down.
                - when
                    - take a shower
                - where
                    - in bathroom
                - how
                    - principle
                        - pressure causes liquid to move
                        - the combination of spring and valves enables one-way flow.
                    - structure
                        - output
                            - output tube
                            - nozzle
                        - chamber
                            - piston
                            - output tube
                            - spring
                            - valve ball
                        - input
                            - input tube
                    - behaviors
                        - pressing the head: push liquid from the chamber to outside
                            - head -> tube -> spring -> ball blocking the downside hole
                            - tube pushed down, then holes on the tube are unblocked, enabling liquid go through from the chamber to the tube under pressure.
                        - moving upwards: pull liquid from the bottle to the chamber
                            - when the out tube moves upwards, holes on it are blocked by the piston.
                            - reduced pressure in the chamber caused by increased space enables liquid overcome resisting force by the spring and enter the chamber from the bottle.
