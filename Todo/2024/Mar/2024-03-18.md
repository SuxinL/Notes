            - [x] how to use it?
                - theory 1: I should open the top opening
                    - pros: to let the desiccant contact with air to absorb moisture.
                    - cons: when the bag falls, the desiccant inside spreads out.
                - theory 2: I should close the top opening.
                    - pros: safety
                    - cons: a risk of insufficient contact between the desiccant and moisture.
