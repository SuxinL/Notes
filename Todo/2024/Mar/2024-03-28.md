    - [x] phone ring: the discrepancy between my prediction and final test
        - case
            - prediction
                - ring strings are more flexible and suitable for complex operations including playing games and taking pictures.
                - back rings are more stable and enable holding a phone with one finger, and they are good for watching a phone for a long duration.
            - test
                - ring strings let the phone hung and shake.
