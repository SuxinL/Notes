    - [x] anxiety of recalling knowledge of github & ssh
        - [x] anxiety of forget
            - case
                - I have not used Git, GitHub or SSH for 2 months.
                - I need to use it, but I am afraid of not remembering the knowledge.
            - solution
                - goal orientation: I had used the knowledge to solve many problems.
                - memory loss: 
                    - catch main structure
                    - doc as a solid backup
                - notice the mechanism of human brains
                    - compress content to leave space of new things
        - [x] recall it
            - solution
                - relax
                    - recall by structure takes time.
                - goal orientation
                    - from what we need to reason the existence of something
                - follow the main structure 
                    - abstraction level
                        - start from top
                        - if a sub system is not needed in the current case, do not specify it. only what and purposes.
                    - about the how part of a cohesive tool.
                        - philosophy
                            - short phrases to memorize easily
                        - diagrams
        - [x] forget the names of a command
            - case
                - I forgot the command to check commit history: `git log`
            - solution
                - **goal orientation**: I need a tool to check commit history
                - relax
                    - based on the information compression procedure of human brains, forget is inevitable.
                - refer to the backup doc
