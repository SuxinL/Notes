                                - many unwanted smells are results of acidic compounds which baking soda can react with to produce less volatile compounds.

                    - mechanism
                        - hyphae tips produce mold spores carried and spread by air or other mediums.
                        - spores land and start to grow once certain conditions are met.
                        - hyphae tips secrete enzymes to degrade complex organisms into simple nutrients which are absorbed by tips.

                        - light: dark, as UV will kill molds
                        - air: closed space helps spores accumulate.

                    - look
                        - color: green, red or black. Spores are pigmented to resist UV.
                        - fuzzy: the hyphae network
                        - dusty: large amounts of spores
                    - smell: the strong moldy smells are due to mVOCs produced in molds' metabolism.

            | Components | 5% acetic acid + 95% water | 70% ethanol + 30% water |
            | Mechanisms | Acetic acid with PH 2.5 can disrupt the metabolism of molds | ethanol can dissolve lipids or mold cells. |

            | Where to use | poor penetration: nonporous surfaces like wall tiles and glass | good penetration: porous materials like clothes, wall or wood |
            | Cautions | 1. It is acidic and can damage rubber, minerals and some types of metals including aluminum, copper and steel. 2. afterward cleanup with water is needed as vinegar has a strong odor. | It is flammable. |
