# Arm Pain in Typing

## Examination
[problem overview]: #

My arms feel painful and sour.

### Context

#### When
[Specification: year, season, daytime, during & after some events]: #

-	**[DURING_TYPING]** When typing for 30 seconds.

#### Where
[Localization]: #


- arms.


### Symptoms
[avoid biases]: #
[comparison between actuation and expectation]: #
[collect evidence used by hypothesis built in the root cause analysis phrase]: #
[specification: location, degree]: #

#### Vision

-	I bend my arms when typing.
-	**[ARMS_HUNG]** I tend to get my arms off my body and hung in the air.

#### Hearing

#### Smell

#### Taste

#### Touch & Feel

-	**[ARM_OUTWARD]** the extremely sour feeling when moving arms outward further.

## Root Cause Analysis
[backward cause reasoning for general problems]: #
[recursive trouble shooting for engineering problems to an atomic level (build hypothesis, use evidence (examination  + unit tests))]: #

TYPING
:	I_BEND_ARMS
	:	The action that I bend arms causes the feeling.
		
		Evidence
		:	Pos
			:	-	Bending down for a while causes a sour feeling.
				-	Bending legs when sleeping causes uncomfortable feeling.
				-	When the pain appears, stretching arms forward relieves it instantly.
				-	**[ARMS_HUNG]** This change decreases the level of bending.

## Brainstorming
[removal of touchable physical objects is applicable]: #
[replacement V.S repair. Localize the problem to an atomic level where fixing it components is more expensive than replacing it as a whole]: #


## Analysis of Solutions

### Comparison
| Solution | Cost | Effective Duration | Side Effects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
 
### Priority & Trace

## Thinking
[Lessons learned from this experience]: #
-	When reasoning in an unfamiliar field, the whole process is just repeating a step, we can find clues from
	-	systematic learning 
	-	examine the posture, and think about which actions cause similar results.
-	**How to handle the trade-off between different approaches?**
-	refinement of solutions: When a solution solves a problem, it might brings new problems.
