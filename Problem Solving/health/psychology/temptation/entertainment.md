- Still watching videos and playing games at Zhou's house.

### Symptoms
[avoid biases]: #
[comparison between actuation and expectation]: #
[collect evidence used by hypothesis built in the root cause analysis phrase]: #
[specification: location, degree]: #

## Root Cause Analysis
[backward cause reasoning for general problems]: #
[interactions: failed good OR bad OR side effects]: #
[recursive trouble shooting for engineering problems to an atomic level (build hypothesis, use evidence (examination  + unit tests))]: #

## Brainstorming
[removal of touchable physical objects is applicable]: #
[replacement V.S repair. Localize the problem to an atomic level where fixing it components is more expensive than replacing it as a whole]: #	

IN_PLAY

	- self **<1>**
		- deep breath
		- wash face with cold water

## Thinking
[Lessons learned from this experience]: #

- We can interrupt an activity in the middle.
- **Notice the importance of evidence in supporting causes.**
- Flaws in thoughts
- Examination helps us to 
	- over confirmation biases
	- find more factors in root cause analysis
- apply solutions backwards
	- for solutions at a same layer, apply them in descending order of
		1. effective duration
		2. cost
