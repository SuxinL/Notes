# Home WIFI slow

## Examination
[problem overview]: #
[a problem can be of services or env of a system]: #

the WIFI speed is low.

### Context

#### When
[Specification: year, season, daytime, during & after some events, duration]: #

- 2025/01

#### Where
[Localization]: #

- HaiYangMingZhu
    - my desk
    - TV in living room
    - extender 2

### Symptoms
[avoid jumping to conclusions and confirmation biases]: #
[collect evidence used by hypothesis built in the root cause analysis phrase]: #
[comparison between actuation and expectation]: #
[specification: location, degree]: #
[when direct examination is hard, we can use tools like light and magnifiers to amplify the signals]: #

#### Hearing

#### Smell

#### Taste

#### Touch & Feel

- theories
    - wifi signals go straight and pass through walls
        - the signal from the router is stronger than that from the extender 1 in parent bed.
    - wood doors do not affect much.

## Root Cause Analysis
[backward cause reasoning for general problems]: #
[recursive trouble shooting for engineering problems to an atomic level (build hypothesis, use evidence (examination  + unit tests))]: #

## Brainstorming
[removal of touchable physical objects is applicable]: #
[replacement V.S repair. Localize the problem to an atomic level where fixing it components is more expensive than replacing it as a whole]: #
