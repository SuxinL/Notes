# Many Pending Tasks

## Examination
[problem overview]: #
[a problem can be of services or env of a system]: #

There are many pending tasks that I only recorded them down but have not finished.

### Context

#### When
[Specification: year, season, daytime, during & after some events, duration]: #

- From June 2023 to December 2024: one and half year.

#### Where
[Localization]: #

- Recorded Notes
    - Thinking
    - Goal achievement
    - Problem solving
    - Learning
    
### Symptoms
[avoid jumping to conclusions and confirmation biases]: #
[collect evidence used by hypothesis built in the root cause analysis phrase]: #
[comparison between actuation and expectation]: #
[specification: location, degree]: #
[when direct examination is hard, we can use tools like light and magnifiers to amplify the signals]: #

#### Vision

- Statistics
    - **[63%]** Many unchecked list items of delayed tasks
        - checked: 63%
        - unchecked: 37%
- Housing

    - Dirty bathroom & kitchen
    - Broken appliances
- Belongings
    - Problematic electronics
    - Incomplete models
- Activities
    - Unlearned
    - Volunteering
- Config
    - bond
    - phones
    
#### Hearing

#### Smell

- Urine odor

#### Taste

#### Touch & Feel

- **[UNSATISFIED]** Unsatisfied
- Regretful of wasted time
    - Sleep too much
    - Entertainment
    - Distraction
    
## Root Cause Analysis
[backward cause reasoning for general problems]: #
[recursive trouble shooting for engineering problems to an atomic level (build hypothesis, use evidence (examination  + unit tests))]: #

### ACCUMULATED_PENDING_TASKS

ACCUMULATED_PENDING_TASKS
:   handle them with a strategy. **<1>**

NO_RECHECK_RULE
:   think of how to check and organize left tasks. **<2>**

~~FORGET~~
:   reasoned view.

FRUSTRATED
:   deep breathe **<3>**

EXHAUSTED
:   rest **<4>**
    - at daytime: rest, nap
    - at night: sleep. 

NOT_HANDLE
:   intervention
    - sticky note **<5>**
    - mental stimulation. **<6>**

DISLIKE
:   - deep breathe. **<7>**
    - think of the benefits of completing these tasks. **<8>**

PENDING_TASKS
:   handle them with a strategy. **<9>**

~~LIMITED_TIME~~
:   The time wasted in bed is gone. Staying up late at night will disrupt my biologic clock further.

NO_DEADLINE
:   set a deadline if I really need to complete the specific task firstly and put off others. **<10>**

### FRUSTRATED

IGNORANCE_RULE_HANDLE_FAILURE
:   Practice that Each mismatch between expectation and actuation is a problem. Solve the problem and learn a lesson. **<11>**

### PENDING_TASKS

NO_GOOD_TASK_MANAGEMENT_SKILL
:   think of how to manage and complete tasks efficiently. **<12>**

RANDOM_THOUGHT
:   intervention **<13>**
    1. deep breathe
    2. recall that these thoughts are 
        - wasting my time
        - killing my willpower
    3. resume working.

RELUCTANCE
:   [reluctance problem](/Problem%20Solving/health/psychology/motivation/reluctance.md)

~~SHORT_CLEAR~~
:   transient effect

DELAY
:   intervention
    - sticky note **<14>**
    - mental stimulation **<15>**
        1. deep breathe
        2. think of the bad effects of delay
            - tasks not done
            - harm self confidence
        3. follow the task management model
            
~~RECORDED_TASKS~~
:   working part. I need them.
