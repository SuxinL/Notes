			- test it during
				- the initial test 
				- the final test
		- for each article
			- for each paragraph, 
				- if the contention is clear is clear, skip the path.
				- else understand the **path** and combine it with our knowledge base.
			- after each section, test
				- the main idea
				- operations
			- at the end, test current main structure
				- if it is complete and meets our requirements.
		- after the final test, 
			- document and manage the main structure well for later reference when memory fails. 
			- apply the knowledge to real-world projects.
