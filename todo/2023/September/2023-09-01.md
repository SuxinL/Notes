- [ ] thinking in repair
	- [ ] how did I figure out the structure
		- [x] toilet
			```mermaid
			flowchart LR
			body ---|bolt| adjuster
			subgraph lid
				shell ---|axis| middle ---|axis| cover
				subgraph socket
					shell ---|slot| adjuster
				end
			end
			```
			- discover 
				- bolt: test: I found the nuts.
				- individual adjuster: 
					- cause: high relevance from design
						- edges flat
						- matched slots 
		- [x] ceiling light
			```mermaid
			flowchart
				cover ---|switch| base ---|screw| ceiling
				subgraph inside
					base --- bulb
				end
			```
			- switch: 
				- others' info: the position is too high to see the structure.
				- test: I check it.
			- screw: test: I see it.
