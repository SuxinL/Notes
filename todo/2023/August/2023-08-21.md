		|   Aspect | Glue | Tape |
		| --- | --- | --- |
		|   bonds | strong | weak |
		|   cycle | not | recycle |
		|   mechanism | The bond forms when the glue dries. | The bond forms after pressing the tape. |
		| 	 difficulty to use | 1. right mixing proportion for two-component glues 2. enough time to cure | the need to remove dirt and air bubbles |
	- [ ] different types of glues
		|   Aspect | PVA | PU | Epoxy | CA |
		|   --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
		|   mechanism | PVA uses water as the solvent, and bonds form after water evaporates. | chemical reaction(resin, hardener, moisture) -> bonds | chemical reaction(resin, hardener) -> bonds |  CR(ca, moisture) |
		|   for | porous stuff (paper, woods) | transportation | heavy structure | crafts |
