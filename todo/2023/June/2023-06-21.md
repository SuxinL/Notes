    - [ ] plantUML V.S mermaid
      - [x] **Why mermaid if plantUML has been existing for long time?** 
        - PlantUML is java-based then it needs a java server. Mermaid is javascript-based so it is easier to deliver on webs.

	  - [x] Is association a subtype of dependency? 
	    - yes
	  - [x] **the purpose of association** 
	    -  to keep long-term or frequently used dependencies for efficiency (eg: Car -> Wheel, Human -> Organ, Customer -> Order)
        
    - [x] aggregation V.S composition
      | Aspect | Aggregation | Composition |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | purpose | to denote a whole/part relationship, but the aggregated object and it parts are independent. |  to denote a whole/part relationship, but command the composite object to manage the scope & lifespan of its parts.|
      | scope | parts can be shared among multiple aggregates. | A part  is owned by one composite at any instant time. |
      | lifespan | parts are alive after aggregates are deleted. | Usually once a composite is deleted all its parts are deleted. But parts can be moved out before.|
      | Example | A polygon consists of segments. A segment can be shared among multiple polygon and remain even if all related polygons are deleted.| An order belongs to A Customer. |
