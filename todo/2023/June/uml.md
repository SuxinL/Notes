    - [x] component
    - [ ] composite structure
    - [ ] deployment
    - [ ] object
    - [ ] package
  - [ ] Behavioral diagrams
    - [ ] activity
    - [ ] communication
    - [ ] interaction overview
    - [ ] sequence
    - [ ] state
    - [ ] timing
    - [ ] use case 
- [ ] **UML relationships**  
- to represent flows of
	- mental process
	- mechanism
		-  mechanics
		-  electronics
- to catch the structure (components, connections) of a system
