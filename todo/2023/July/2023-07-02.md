- [ ] methodologies in problem solving
  1. backward root cause reasoning starting from the final symptoms **to find causes of different depths.**

	   - physiological problems
         - [ ] mold smell

         - rotten smell in the kitchen
         - bad sleep
       - engineering problems 
         - Mechanics
           - Bike
             - brake disc adjustment to avoid friction
             - speed switch system 
           - Chair
             - rubber stripe fastener
         - Eletronic
	       - Laptop
	         - Cannot write to the disk. Find the broken component.  
       - psychological problems

  2. For each interaction, forward analysis of the process flow **to organize involved components** 
     - **Principle: Any component broken will make the whole path broken.**
     - ==supports Why we learn from materials systematically.==
     1. if the output is from an interaction that should not exist (its components should not exist) at all like the mold, smell and mental health problems, apply forward analysis on the interaction and remove components.
     2. else if output is from an interaction that should exist but failed (**its components and interfaces** are required but problematic) like the laptop write failures, frictions in brake system, bad speed switch system and chair stripe come-out, apply forward analysis on the expected good interaction, then replace problematic components or adjust interfaces.
		```mermaid

			subgraph system
				component1 ---|interface| component2 ---|interface| component3
			end

		- problems
		  - composite
		    - any component or interface
		  - leaf
		    - missed
		    - wrong type
		    - deformed
		  - interface
		    - mismatched form factors
		    - loosen or separated       
     3. use **unit tests** to find contributing factors to the output. recursively apply this step if a contributing factor is composite.
