- [x] why `systemctl list-units` does not show scope units
  - This command only shows units loaded or tried to load, while scope units are not configured via configuration files but created programmatically.
		
- [x] thinking flow of finding the Chrome cgroup.
  1. There must be some mechanism to manage so many processes in a system (like a tree), and I remember that cgroups is a way to manage resource usages.
  2. after learning basics of cgroups, I firstly use `systemd-cgls` to check the static view of the cgroups hierarchy, and I find Chrome unit.
  3. then I use `systemd-cgtop` to check a dynamic view: the runtime resource usages of the Chrome cgroup.
