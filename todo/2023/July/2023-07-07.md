  - [ ] Is systemd journal a superset of the  kernal ring buffer?
- [x] **swapfiles are temporary?** 

  Swapon makes effect only during current session. After reboot the swap area is off.

  **Remember to add a line about the swap area to file /etc/fstab to make system turn on it after each reboot.** 

- [x] start to test whether Chrome pages are still cleared overnight when swap area is enabled.  

  NO.   
- [ ] analyse the case of chrome crash in which I missed a critical step of making the swap area permanent. --> **prevention**
- [ ] itch at my balls
- [ ] typing posture
