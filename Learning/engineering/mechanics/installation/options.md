# Options

During installation, we might make decisions like which side of a plate should face upwards. Unless an unit is totally symmetric, different arrangement will have different performance.

Critical thinking is needed in this decision making process.

## Cause

In order to reduce risk and cost, we firstly reason from 
- the structure of components 
- goals of these components.

## Test

During reasoning, there are usually multiple factors to consider of which some might be out of our knowledge, and test will determine whether a way is correct.

In cases that test is very cheap, we can try it even without reasoning.

However, for some cases, test is hard. Firstly, failure only happens in extreme situations but the cost of failure are very high for some cases like testing a wrongly assembled vehicle. Secondly, the effect is only visible in a long term for some cases like testing an dehumidifier. For all these cases, reasoning before testing is crucial.  

## shortcut

(test by others) if how to install is not important to us and there are references, we can just mimic them.
