| goals | to verify identity | to verify identity |
| where | to log in to online accounts | to unlock a physical device |
| store | stored in servers | stored locally in devices |
| ease to use | long and complex, but pasting is allowed. | short, but requiring manual entering. |
| platform | can be used access an accounts from different platforms | tied to a device |
| security | might be stolen from the servers (channels between clients and servers are usually encrypted nowadays) | 1. stored locally, then no cyber attacks risks 2. wrong input limits improve security |


Q: why are online passwords usually not implemented as a form of being simple and having limited trials?
	
A malicious user can try random passwords on your accounts **somewhere else** to disable you from logging in.
