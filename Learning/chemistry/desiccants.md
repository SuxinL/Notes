## common used ones comparisons

| Aspect | silica gel | calcium chloride |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chemical components | $SiO_2$ | $CaCl_2$ |
| Mechanism | Adsorption: Silica gel is porous and has a high specific surface area, which allows it to adsorb water readily. | Absorption: Calcium chloride is highly water dissolvable. It absorbs water and becomes solution.|
| Forms | Non-hydrated: hard, translucent grains. Saturated: still hard. | Non-hydrated: while crystalline solid.  Saturated: solution. |
| Speed | Slow | Fast |
| Capacity | up to 37%. Capacity remains regardless humility.| Up to 200%. Capacity boosts as humility rises. |
| Safety | Non-toxic | Non-toxic, but can cause skin irritation.|
| Cost | Middle | Low |
| Use | 1. in small space 2. low humility | 1. in large space 2. high humility. |
