# Tyvek

## main points 

- what
    - a synthetic material.
- purpose
    - efficiency
        - breathable
        - tear resistant
        - lightweight
    - safety
        - water resistant

## body

- components
    - HDPE fibers
- management
    - interaction
        - spunbond: fibers are randomly lied on a platform by air flow to avoid any alignment for the sheet to be tear resistant.
        - fiber density balance: make the sheet breathable and water resistant.

## notice

- SIDE_NOT_AFFECT: two sides of a sheet have different textures, one smoother than the other. Both placements have the same performance.
