# Split APK

- main points
    - what
        - a new Android app delivery mechanism. An app is divided into module represented as split APKs, and splits will be delivered into a device **on demand**.
        - a split APK is similar to a normal APK and can be installed on a device, but split APKs of an app can communicate with each other and share common resources. Therefore, we can not install an app by installing its split APKs one by one using a normal installer. **A special tool to connect these splits is needed.**
