# AAB

- main points
    - what
        - Android App Bundle. It is the new official Android application **publishing** format. Developers now upload the AAB file of their application to Google Play. An AAB file must contain all compiled code and resource for an app.
    - purposes
        - efficiency
            - developer
                - A developer does not need to build, sign and manage different APKs for different platforms by itself. Instead, he just uploads one AAB file, and Google Play will generate split APKs, sign them, deliver and install needed ones into a device.
