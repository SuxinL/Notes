# Shampoo Pump

## what

A shampoo pump is a small device to pump shampoo liquid from the bottle for use.

## purposes

- efficiency
    - just press the head and no need to turn the bottle upside down.

## when

- take a shower
  
## where

- in bathroom

## how

### principle

- Pressure causes liquid to move.
- The combination of 2 valves enables one-way flow.

### structure

- output
    - output tube
    - nozzle
- chamber
    - chamber body
    - upper valve
        - piston
    - spring
    - lower valve   
        - ball
- input
    - input tube

### behaviors

- pressing the head: push liquid from the chamber to outside
    - the lower valve closed: head -> output tube -> spring -> ball blocking the downside hole
    - the upper valve opened: the output tube is pushed down, then holes on the tube which were covered by the piston are unblocked, enabling liquid go through from the chamber to the tube under pressure.
- moving upwards: pull liquid from the bottle to the chamber
    - the upper valve closed: when the output tube moves upwards, holes on it are blocked by the piston.
    - the lower valve opened: reduced pressure in the chamber caused by increased space enables liquid overcome resisting force by the spring and enter the chamber from the bottle.
