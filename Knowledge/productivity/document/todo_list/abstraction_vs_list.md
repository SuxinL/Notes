# Abstraction V.S List

| Aspect | Abstraction | List |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What | add abstract intermediate tasks | list tasks |
| Example | learning -> English words -> allege | learning --> authy |
| overhead | much if many levels of abstraction | little |
| flexibility | no | high |
| info | names of intermediate abstract tasks tell much info about final atomic tasks | little |
| use cases | 1. many atomic tasks. 2. for **thinking** tasks where I need to follow the exact procedures when applying the models.  3. the atomic task name itself is **ambiguous or less self-explanatory**. | 1. the name of the task is self-explanatory AND just a few tasks |

##  Solution

Apply the use case check at each group to decide whether to abstract further or just list.
