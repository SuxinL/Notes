## Where

## How

### Types

- Type I (the common one)

### Body Fluids

HIV can not live long after leaving human bodies, and only certain types of body fluids can transmit HIV.

- Transmittable

- Not transmittable
    - tears

    - saliva
    - urine

### Stages

There are 3 stages of HIV.
1. acute infection
2. chronic infection
3. AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)

| | Acute | Chronic | AIDS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Duration | ~3 months | ~10 years | ~3 years before death |
| Viral Load | the highest | low | high |
| Symptoms | flu-like | none | opportunistic infections |

The flu-like symptoms in the acute infection stage:
- head
    - fever
    - night sweats
    - fatigue
    - mouth ulcers
- neck
    - sore throat
    - swollen lymph nodes
- body
    - chill

        - vaginal sex
        - anal sex
- low risks
    - sex

        - hand shaking
        - close-mouth kiss
    - sharing
        - dishes
        - toilets

### Factors

- viral load: The high viral load, the more possible a person transmits HIV.
- other STDs: If you have other STDs, you are more likely to get HIV.
- drugs or alcohol: These substances lower a person's inhibition and rational thinking ability, then he or she is more likely to engage in highly risky activities.
