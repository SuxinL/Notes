# viruses VS bacteria VS fungi

| Aspect | Viruses | Bacteria | Fungi |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Size(micrometers) | 0.025 ~ 0.35 | 0.3 ~ 5 | 3 ~ 10 |
| Structure | Simple. A virus has genome which can be DNA or RNA in a protein capsule. | Complex. Bacteria have genome surrounded by a cell wall, and many types of bacteria have flagella which enable them to move independently. | In contract to viruses and bacteria, A fungus have a nucleus and other cell elements. |
| Habitats | They can survive on surfaces for weeks, but hosts are needed for long-term survival. | Everywhere including the air, water, foods or bodies. | Molds like damp environments. |
| Reproduction | After viruses enter a host, they attach on cells and inject their genome into these cells. The genome replicate and viruses multiply inside host cells which eventually break apart. | Unlike viruses which are not counted as living, bacteria are unicellular living organisms. They metabolite and reproduce by cell division. | 1. cell division 2. spores which grow under appropriate environments |
| Hazards | Viruses destroy host cells. | Bacteria produce toxins during metabolism. | 1. respiratory tract irritation 2. allergies 3. mycotoxins|
