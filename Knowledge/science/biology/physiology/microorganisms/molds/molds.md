## where

- indoor
    - bathroom

    - cabinet

## how

### structure

- hypha: a long, branching structure of a fungus consisting of one or more cells.
- mycelium: a network of hyphae. 

### growth

- mechanism
    - hyphae tips produce mold spores carried and spread by air or other mediums.
    - spores land and start to grow once certain conditions are met.
    - hyphae tips secrete enzymes to degrade complex organisms into simple nutrients which are absorbed by tips. 
- conditions 
    - food: any organisms
    - moisture: > 60%
    - temperature: 25 ~ 30
    - light: dark, as UV will kill molds
    - air: closed space helps spores accumulate.

### out appearance

- look
    - color: green, red or black. Spores are pigmented to resist UV.
    - shape: fuzzy due to the hyphae network
    - texture: dusty due to large amounts of spores
- smell: the strong moldy smells are due to mVOCs produced in molds' metabolism.

### hazards

- ways
    - breathe in
    - touch
    - swallow
- effects
    - general: upper respiratory tract irritations.
    - spores: infection
    - allergens: allergies
    - mycotoxins
        - neurologic 
            - fatigue
            - memory loss
        - cancer & death
