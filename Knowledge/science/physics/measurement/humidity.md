# Humidity

## what

- humidity is a measure of how much water vapor in the air.
    - absolute humidity
        - a measure of how much water vapor in the air at any one time ($g/m^3$) 
    - relative humidity
        - the ratio of the volume of current water vapor to the maximal that the air can hold at that time. (%)
            $$RH = \frac{current \space vapor \space density}{saturation \space vapor \space density}$$

## purposes

- security
    - high humidity (> 60%)
        - molds
        - dust mites
    - low humidity (< 30%)
        - itching
        - easy spread of influenza viruses
## how

- factors
    - temperature
        - Temperature can change the saturation vapor density positively. The higher the temperature, the more water vapor the air can hold, which means the relative humidity decreases when the absolute humidity does not change.
