# How Heat Affects Foods

## what

Heat alters raw foods into what we want.

## purpose

- efficiency
    - digestibility
    - flavor
- security
    - to kill food borne poisoning bacteria

## how

### safety

- Food borne poisoning bacteria can be found in raw poultry, meat and vegetables.
- Cooking with heat can kill most of them.
    - temperature: over 80C inside
    - duration: 2 mins

### flavor

- protein
    - denaturation

        Heat breaks hydrogen bonds holding amino acid strands, which then enable these strands to unfold and react with other substances to form new structures.
        - conditions
            - temp: > 60C
        - effects
            - harden: most meats transform from a runny, fluid texture to a firm one.
            - soften: collagen -> gelatine
- starch
    - Gelatinization

        When heated, starches absorb liquids around them.
        - conditions
            - temp: > 66C
            - liquid
        - effects
            - swell
            - soften
    - Degradation
        When heated, starch molecules break down into glucoses.
        - effects
            - starchy foods become sweeter.
- sugar
    - caramelization    

        When heat is applied, sugar decomposes into its component molecules. Then a further series of complex chemical reactions take place between the molecules.
        - conditions
            - temp: 180C
        - effects
            - brown color
            - complex flavor
- amino acid
    - Maillard Reaction

        Under heat, amino acids react with reducing sugars.
        - condition
            - reducing sugars
        - effects
            - brown outside
            - complex flavor

### digestibility

- starch
    - cause: Starches degrade into glucoses which is easier to digest.
- protein
    - test: Cooked eggs are 180% more digestible.
