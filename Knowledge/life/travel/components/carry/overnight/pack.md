# Pack

- CASE
    - CS-SZ:
        - CS -> SZ: from CS to SZ, I only pack things that I will need in SZ because I will come back to my room in CS where there are all other things needed and remained.
        - SZ -> CS: 
            - ALL: from SZ to CS, I need to pack almost all things that I have brought to SZ because 
                - I will NOT come back to the room in SZ.
                - there might be things that I carried to SZ which
                    - will not be used in CS
                    - BUT is useful in other places **in a long term**.
            - FOR_ZHOU: I leave things carried for Zhou at his room in SZ.

            - BACK: if I will come back
                - NEEDED: only think of things needed in the destination.
        - For NO_LEFT
            - NO_BACK: if I will not come back
                - **PREVENTION**
                    - ALL: carry almost all things I have carried to the current place.
                    - ADDITIONAL_CONSIDERATION:
