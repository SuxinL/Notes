# Name of the problem

## Examination
[problem overview]: #
[a problem can be the output or input of a process. For output, it can be a bad output. For input, it can be a waste of resources]: #

### Context

#### When
[Specification: year, season, daytime, during & after some events, duration]: #

#### Where
[Localization]: #

### Symptoms
[avoid biases]: #
[comparison between actuation and expectation]: #
[collect evidence used by hypothesis built in the root cause analysis phrase]: #
[specification: location, degree]: #

#### Vision

#### Hearing

#### Smell

#### Taste

#### Touch & Feel

## Root Cause Analysis
[backward cause reasoning for general problems]: #
[interactions: failed good OR bad OR side effects]: #
[recursive trouble shooting for engineering problems to an atomic level (build hypothesis, use evidence (examination  + unit tests))]: #

## Brainstorming
[removal of touchable physical objects is applicable]: #
[replacement V.S repair. Localize the problem to an atomic level where fixing it components is more expensive than replacing it as a whole]: #
