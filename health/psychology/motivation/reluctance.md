# Reluctance

## Examination
[problem overview]: #
[a problem can be of services or env of a system]: #

I feel reluctant to do challenging things.

### Context

#### When
[Specification: year, season, daytime, during & after some events, duration]: #

- date: 2023, Oct
- after: The trip to Guilin, then a cold.
- duration: 3 weeks

#### Where
[Localization]: #

- handling health problems
	- Zhou's knee pains
	- my cold
	- my grandmother's thirst
- practicing the modified root cause analysis model

### Symptoms
[avoid biases]: #
[collect evidence used by hypothesis built in the root cause analysis phrase]: #
[comparison between actuation and expectation]: #
[specification: location, degree]: #

#### Vision

- I tend to have a rest by playing phone or do easier things like house cleaning when facing these challenges.

#### Hearing

#### Smell

#### Taste

#### Touch & Feel

- I am not familiar of health issues
- I worry that I can not solve these problems.
- I have not tested the new model for new problems, and I worry that it will not fit these new cases.

## Root Cause Analysis
[backward cause reasoning for general problems]: #
[recursive trouble shooting for engineering problems to an atomic level (build hypothesis, use evidence (examination  + unit tests))]: #

```

PERSON_AND_ENV
:	PERSON
	:	BODY
		:	My body can not reach its optimal performance.
		
		MIND
		:	COSTS_GREATER_THAN_BENEFITS
			:	I think that the costs of doing a certain thing are greater than its benefits.
			
			LAZINESS
			:	Not willing to work.
	PHONE
	:	Phones are tempting.

```mermaid

	LESS_INFORMATION --> UNCERTAINTY
```	

UNCERTAINTY
:	UNCLEAR
	:	I am unclear of these things.

	CONSERVATION
	:	If I am unclear of something, I tend to be conservative, focusing on the worst case.
	 
LESS_INFORMATION
:	LITTLE_KNOWLEDGE
	:	little previous knowledge about the case.
	
	CHALLENGE
	:	Hard to figure out costs and benefits.

	I_CHALLENGE
	:	**I have not examined the case enough.** 


## Brainstorming
[removal of touchable physical objects is applicable]: #
[replacement V.S repair. Localize the problem to an atomic level where fixing it components is more expensive than replacing it as a whole]: #

~~RELUCTANCE~~
:	an emotion.

~~COSTS_GREATER_THAN_BENEFITS~~
:	an idea.

PHONE
:	refer to the problem solving of *health.psychology.temptation.entertainment* **<1>**

~~UNCLEAR~~
:	an idea.

CONSERVATION
:	practice an open mind by **<2>**
	- doing 3 things that I am unwilling to do everyday.
	- relaxation including deep breath.

LITTLE_KNOWLEDGE
:	learn its basics online. **<3>**

CHALLENGE
:	learn whether the problem is solvable and deserves my effort online. **<4>**

I_CHALLENGE
:	This is a **chicken-egg** problem. 

	*I have NOT tested it enough. -> reluctance -> I do not want to test it.*

	**Incremental improvement**: 
	- Initial triggers:	By firstly handling other causes, the reluctance will be reduced, then I will start to touch it.
	- Divide and conquer: specify the process recursively, and take a small step each time. **<5>**
 
 ## Analysis of Solutions	

### Comparison
| Solution | Cost | Effective Duration | Side Effects & Risks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | HIGH | ? | NOT_ENOUGH |
| 2 | LOW | ? | NOT_ENOUGH |
| 3 | MIDDLE | LONG | NOT_ENOUGH |
| 4 | MIDDLE | LONG | NOT_ENOUGH |
| 5 | MIDDLE | LONG | LITTLE |

### Priority & Trace
[try from treatments to prevention based on time bound]: #

- 3 
- 4
- 5
- 2
- 1

## Thinking
[Deduction: Lessons learned from this experience]: #

- perceptions are the interface between a person and the object to determine behaviors.
- perceptions -> ideas
- **examination is very important for overcoming biases.**
