# Anxiety of Internal Knowledge "Not Good enough"

## Problem Description

I feel sweaty and short breath *when I encounter materials related to knowledge that I have learned before*. As a result, I avoid touching them.

## Root Cause Analysis

<- I worry there might be differences between my knowledge and those materials. 
	
- I have spent much effort to learn. The differences might make me feel that my hard working does not pay back. Or I need to relearn. 
- Maybe I have applied my flawed knowledge to some projects in which bad things might happen in the future.
  
<- I forget or what I have learned is conflicting with the current information.
  
## Possible Solutions

Nothing is perfect including our memories even books which might be outdated years later.

### Goal Orientation 

As long as our knowledge has succeeded in solving our problems, we have met our stage goal. The "flawed" tool helped us build our current platform where we can refine our tool. 

### Catching the main structure

**Do not try to remember the text verbatim which is not only unrealistic but useless.** The final goal of learning is to use the knowledge as a tool to solve problems. Then it is desired for the knowledge in our mind to be generic to solve a group of problems. Always remember to test whether we have catch the main structure and internalize the knowledge immediately after learning something. 

  The main structure remains stable as the format of target problems. When we encounter some materials related later on, compare the main structure in our mind and that of the materials. Update our knowledge if needed. It is fine that we do not remember some details like who, when, where and single steps. Search it when we really need it. Try to see materials like notes and books as backup when our memories fail rather than judgement of our abilities.
