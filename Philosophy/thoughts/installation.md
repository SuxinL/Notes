# Installation

To install a system by assembling its units efficiently, we try in the following order to find the first working approach.
1. check the installation manual
2. if the manual is unavailable or does not provide enough details, we try to install the system based on its structure.
3. the last resort is to try and learn from mistakes.

## Check Manuals 

This is the most efficient way of installation. It not only saves time by giving us a predefined roadmap, but also saves money by reducing the risk of damaging units.

## Structure

For systems with a good structure, we can firstly understand its structure recursively before the installation process.

There are 2 orders of building connections of components.

### Main Connection First

This is the straight forward way following our thinking flow.

- pros
    - a clear roadmap
- cons
    - It requires to adjust the position of the whole bulk when installing small units.
  
### Main Connection Last

This one is less less straight forward, but it has huge advantages in installing complex systems.

- pros
    - localize risks
        - less overall energy cost
        - better unit tests
- cons
    - careful plan and process tracking needed
 
## Learn From Doing

When there is no well illustrated manuals and the system has a poor structure, we have to try.

### Evaluate Risks

Before each step, evaluate the risks of this step.
