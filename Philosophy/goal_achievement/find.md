# find

This article describes how to find a target efficiently. 

There are 2 types of methods:
- find via structures
- find via search boxes

## find via structures

This is the general method to search for anything. A good organized structure facilitates efficient search. For different scopes, there are different preparation works needed.

### from Knowledge

If we search from our own knowledge, we need to maintain the knowledge structure, usually with goal orientation principle. In other words, we divide a system into sub ones based on functionalities recursively.

The search process itself is fluent because we have known the structure.

### from others' systems

However, **we need to firstly check the actual structure if we tend to search from others' systems** as there are different ways to organize a system. Goal orientation is the most stable way because the purpose of an object usually does not change whereas its out appearance or compositions vary, but different systems might focus on different aspects even change its focus overtime. Making a wrong assumption might waste us lots of time in searching later. 

#### On devices with small screens

Many responsive pages hide the menu for better display on small screens of portable devices. Then we can only see one tab each time.

To access the menu and other related resources, search for links or icons representing menus.

## find via search engines

[This method](/Learning/engineering/electronics/software/browser/Search_Skills.md) works only for digital information. We want to use it when
- Casual Search: We only do casual search and do not have to understand the structure.
- The system is hard to organize
    - poorly organized.
    - very large like the Internet.
- Last Resort: When finding via structures fails.
