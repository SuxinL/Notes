# Move

## Side Effects

Moving something from a place to another place involves the break and build of interfaces between the object and its environment. Along this path from the source to the destination, we need to check and handle affected things

### the final direct interface

- the effects on the moved subject. For instance, if a pot is dirty, we need to clean it before putting foods into it.
- the effects on the new env. If food is too hot, we need to cool it for a while before sending it to our mouths.

### containers

- for a reusable container like a box or a drawer, we need to make it return to its initial state like closing it.
    - itself: close the container
    - its location: put it into where it is stored originally.
- for a one-time-use container, like the package of the subject moved, we dispose it well as garbage.

## Efficiency

To move something efficiently, we need to specify how to move it in some aspects.

### Force Chosen

- Human force

    For small objects, human forces are enough, such as picking a bag and holding a cup.
- Natural force
    
    For large ones like cars, people and furniture, natural forces are needed.
    - electricity
    - flues
    - water
    - wind

### Additional Tools

- efficiency

    The native interface between the force source and the object might be not appropriate to transmit the force efficiently (pressure too small), and additional tools as adapters are used. For instance, to pump up a tire of a bike, a bike pump with a tiny mouse is used to transform the air flow caused by hand into another of high pressure. 
- safety

    The native interface between the force source and the object might also cause damages to either part. It is better to wear protecting gloves to take objects with sharp points like durians and pineapples, or to wear soft gloves to take delicate ones like electronic units including micro chips.
