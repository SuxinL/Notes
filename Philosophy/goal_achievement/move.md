# Move

Moving something from a place to another place involves the break and build of interfaces between the object and its environment. Along this path from the source to the destination, we need to check and handle affected things
- containers
    - for a reusable container like a box or a drawer, we need to make it return to its initial state like closing it.
    - for a one-time-use container, like the package of the subject moved, we dispose it well as garbage.
- the final direct interface
    - the effects on the moved subject. For instance, if a pot is dirty, we need to clean it before putting foods into it.
    - the effects on the new env. If food is too hot, we need to cool it for a while before sending it to our mouths.
