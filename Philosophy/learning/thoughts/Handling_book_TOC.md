# Should we remember the main structure(TOC) of an article or a book?

No, we only need to remember main structures of **frequently used things**.

Knowledge belongs to this type. We maintain the main structure of knowledge in brain to
- quickly find the points which can be applied to the current situation.
- easily extend or adjust the structure to refine the knowledge.

We do not use a book or an article directly frequently. Books or articles are **NOT** knowledge, but **interpretations** of knowledge. We need their TOCs
- when we learn from the material the first time to build the learning road map.
- to quickly find what we want later on when memory fails.
In another word, only when we need to refer to a book to refine our knowledge model, we need its TOC.

The cost of remembering TOCs of books usually exceeds its benefit. It can help us to find we want more quickly without the need to check the TOC each time, but we will read many books in our lives, then the accumulate overhead is large. Besides, the TOC is light weight, then understanding it when required is easy.

**It helps to understand the patterns of TOCs for different types of books.** For electronic devices, their manuals contains safety instructions and hardware structure diagrams.
